<h1 class="title">Cybernetics and Design</h1>
<p class="author">Arianna Salazar Miranda</p>
<p>Cybernetics is a discipline that seeks to understand the role of communication in controlling social, biological, and technical systems. The discipline became prominent by developing successful solutions to problems having to do with gunfire control and missile guidance during the American war effort in World War II. However, these innovations did not remain confined to the defense sector. Instead, they spread, seeking civilian applications in both the private and public sector.<span class="citation" data-cites="light_warfarewelfare_2005"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p>One of the pathways through which Cybernetics influenced design was generative architecture. An approach to architectural design that was itself a process, and resisted a specific form or representation as the end goal. This new approach to architecture combined cybernetics, artificial intelligence, graph theory, cognitive psychology, and computer science.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to map actors in the field of cybernetics in order to show their relationship and influence on design. I use a social graph to illustrate the connections. Subjects are connected to each other if they 1) co-authored together (by way of either remote collaborations or working together in the same university or laboratory), or 2) presenting work at the same conference (occasional event). This approach has also been used by,<span class="citation" data-cites="anderson_cyberneticsthought_2017"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span>,<span class="citation" data-cites="till_invisibleagency_2012a"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> and<span class="citation" data-cites="dubberly_howcybernetics_2015"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> to study connections between scientists, architects, and designers, respectively. My resulting network combines the subset of these networks that is relevant for cybernetics and its relationship to design with complementary sources in a comprehensive way.</p>
<p>To draw the social graph, I combine two primary sources of data. First, I use data on publications collected by the University of Illinois to identify the key players in the network.<span class="citation" data-cites="anderson_cyberneticsthought_2017"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> In particular, I use the digitized data on collaborations published by Heinz von Foerster, W. Ross Ashby, Warren S. McCulloch, and Norbert Wiener — four founding members of cybernetics. These data include four categories: 1) the cybernetic subjects extracted from the texts, 2) the associated person (cyberneticians, scientists, and other individuals important to the cybernetics community), 3) cybernetic classification (a broad category), and 4) the certainty or likelihood that the text belongs in that category. Second, I use digitized records from historical exhibitions, magazines, and newspapers to identify relevant events where cyberneticians exchanged ideas and, conceivably, influenced each other directly.<span class="citation" data-cites="pertigkiozoglou_architecturalrelevance_2017"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> By combining these two sources of data, I map individuals according to their conference attendance, and get a sense of which influential ideas they might have exchanged at these conferences.</p>
<p>Interesting relationships emerge between individuals from different intellectual camps. Scientists like Steward Brand, for example, played an important intermediary role, bridging scientists and designers like Nicholas Negroponte, Christopher Alexander, and other architects such as Buckminster Fuller, Peter Cook, and Reyner Banham that were part of the regulation and feedback movement. In particular, there are a handful of key scientists that had ties with design scholars at the time. For example, scientists like Norbert Wiener and Heinz Von Foerster had the greatest number of ties with designers. This might be explained by the fact that Von Foerster, for example, presented to designers at important design conferences such as the Industrial Design Education Association (IDEA) and the 1962 Aspen Design Conference.<span class="citation" data-cites="pangaro_pastfuturecybernetics_2007"><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> Important design figures that were part of the American Society of Cybernetics, such as Serge Chermayeff—who taught architecture at Harvard and Yale, and published with Christopher Alexander—also spoke at the IDEA conference.</p>
<p>The Macy Conferences also played an important role, disseminating knowledge in a wide range of subject areas. As far as cybernetics were concerned, this series of conferences sought to lay the foundation for the discipline by fostering interdisciplinary research among a community of scholars and researchers. Overall, Macy Conference participants shared an approach to science that was founded on interdisciplinary discussion. The conferences brought together participants from a wide range of fields that included physicists, mathematicians, electrical engineers, sociologists, and cultural anthropologists. For example, many scientists participated in the 1950’s series of cybernetics conferences; attendees included Gregory Bateson, J.C.R. Licklider, Warren McCulloch, Margaret Mead, Ross Ashby, and Claude Shannon.<span class="citation" data-cites="pias_cyberneticsmacy_2016"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Another pivotal cybernetician was Gordon Pask, whose work would help to set the foundations for thought around dynamic, responsive and interactive environments. He envisioned buildings and cities that could adapt over short periods of time and interact with the people who inhabit them. His rationale was that architects were “system designers who had to take interest in the organisational system properties of development, communication and control.”<span class="citation" data-cites="frazer_architecturalrelevance_1995"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span> Pask had close collaborations with the architects Cedric Price and Nicholas Negroponte, and also to scientists like Stafford Beer, Horst Rittel, and Donald Schon. Most of the connections between scholars in science and design fell under his influence (see diagram). Gordon Pask’s pivotal role may be explained by the nature of his work, which unlike traditional scientific approaches, was highly interdisciplinary.<span class="citation" data-cites="hamiltonfrazer_cyberneticsarchitecture_2001a"><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Architects and designers were influenced by cybernetics in ways that went far beyond the initial wartime applications of the discipline. This project outlines some of those relationships through which cybernetics might have influenced design and points at a handful of actors and events that were pivotal to how individuals from different fields came together.</p>
