<h2>Eric Robsky Huntley</h2>
<p>
Eric Robsky Huntley is Technical Instructor of GIS, Data Visualization and Graphics in the MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning and a PhD Candidate in the University of Kentucky Department of Geography's New Mappings Collaboratory. Robsky Huntley's current research program, supported by an MIT Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences grant, critically examines the history of spatial representation in the urban disciplines, asking how computational and cartographic techniques have functioned in design practice and pedagogy; what have digital maps told the designer about what action is possible? He is a 2018 recipient of MIT's Teaching with Digital Technologies award.

<h2>Arianna Salazar Miranda</h2>
<p>
Arianna is a PhD student in the MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning. She develops measures of the built environment using data crowdsourced from social media or collected by sensors. Using spatial analysis and visualization, she studies how the design of urban spaces affects socioeconomic outcomes, including segregation, economic vitality, and social network cohesion. Arianna was recently named an Innovator Under 35 by the MIT Technology Review in Latin America and is a co-founder of Bitsence, a startup that develops technology to measure the impact of urban interventions.

<h2>Agnes Cameron</h2>
<p>
Agnes Cameron is a Master’s student at the MIT Media Lab, working as a research assistant in the Viral Communications Group. Her research interests lie in the formation of local and heterogeneous networks, the decentralized internet, networked community organizing, and infrastructure legibility. She holds a MEng in Information and Computer Engineering from the University of Cambridge, where she did work on slime moulds, robotics and self-organizing systems.

<h2>Daniel L. Engelberg</h2>
<p>
Daniel Engelberg is a PhD student in the MIT Department of Urban Studies and planning. His current research investigates how planners plan for deep uncertainty, what can be done to improve these processes, and computational tools to aid such efforts. His research also includes socio-environmental synthesis, urban systems modeling, and sustainable urban development. This often has him experimenting with large scale urban models with and of which he is equally enthralled and suspicious. Daniel earned his Masters of Community Planning from the University of Maryland and his Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from Bates College.

<h2>Dylan Halpern</h2>
<p>
Dylan Halpern is a first year Master in City Planning in the MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning. His work sits at the intersection of data visualization and community-building, exploring design, sensing, and mapping alongside critical practice and tool-making. Dylan received a 2016 Fulbright Brazil study and research grant to study the erasure of visual culture in advertising and street art in São Paulo. Before coming to urban planning, Dylan was a designer working in graphic, architectural, and community design.  He holds a BFA in Graphic Design with a minor in Urban and Regional Studies from Virginia Commonwealth University.

<h2>Adrianna Boghozian</h2>
<p>
Adrianna is a first year Master’s student in MIT’s Technology and Policy Program and a research fellow in the Tata Center for Technology and Design where she is working to improve upon modeling and deployment strategies for low-cost air quality sensor networks in urban India. Adrianna is interested in how digital technologies and data science can be best utilized to better understand urban problems. Prior to MIT, she worked as a data analyst at an education technology and policy nonprofit in San Francisco and held research assistantships at Stanford Law School and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Adrianna graduated from the University of Tennessee Knoxville with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics.

<h2>Jay Dev</h2>
<p>
Jay is a second year Master of City Planning student in the MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning. His work focuses on using visualization and storytelling to connect civic data to communities to help them co-create knowledge and inform policy. Jay has worked with the MIT Center for Civic Media, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, and the Boston UJIMA Project on projects related to data storytelling, and has previously done research on health policy microsimulation and urban place-based policies. Jay earned a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and African and Afro-American Studies from Brandeis University.

<h2>Maia Woluchem</h2>
<p>
Maia Woluchem is a Masters in City Planning candidate at MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning, working on issues of housing, socioeconomic and racial equity, and the use of local data in city policymaking and advancing justice. She’s most interested in the intersection of data and social marginality, which she recently explored as Rappaport Fellow with the Department of Innovation and Technology of the City of Boston. Before entering her graduate program, Maia was a policy researcher focusing on place-based urban policy in Washington, DC. Maia graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a Bachelor of Science in Economics.
