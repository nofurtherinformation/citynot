    <h2 id="the-numerate-fortune-teller">The Numerate Fortune-Teller</h2>
    <p>In 1964, the University of Iceland’s new computing center took delivery of an IBM 1620 Model II scientific computer, the purchase of which was financed largely by the Icelandic Development Bank.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> On arrival, the machine corresponded to no word in the Icelandic language. In many language traditions, a loanword would suffice to describe the device. The Icelandic Language Council, however, enforced (and enforces) a fairly rigorous policy of linguistic purism, or what Ari Páll Kristinsson, past director of said council, more prosaically refers to as the ‘Icelandic vocabulary tradition’. Since at least the 17th century it has been conventional that new technological and conceptual arrivals are challenges that can be met by old words recombined or repurposed.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>

    </div>
    <p>The task of naming the newly arrived device fell to Sigurður Nordal, a University of Iceland philologist, diplomat, author of major texts on Icelandic culture, sagas, and literature, as well as the former Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> Nordal proposed a new portmanteau to describe the IBM machine. It would be a <em>tölva</em>, a portmanteau of <em>tala</em>—meaning ‘number’—and <em>völva</em> - meaning ‘fortune-teller.’<span class="citation"><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> Computation was thus playfully tied to spiritualism and to prophecy, to futures and to numeracy. In this way, it became the case that to speak of computation in Icelandic is to speak of what is visible in numerical silhouette through the fog of the yet-unknown.</p>
    <p>In the world that we now occupy—‘we’ here being shorthand for the relative elites of the colonizer nations—it is still the case that computation has the persistent sheen of the world-yet-to-come, alternatively u- and dystopian. We live in a moment of acute computational fervor that whiplashes between apocalyptic and messianic. It is not controversial to acknowledge the degree to which many actors in our milieu see salvation from our accumulated messes shimmering in the growth of the planet’s computational carrying capacity and in data-driven urban interventions built ‘from the internet up’ (in the language of Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs). This is the case even as a persistent drumbeat of leaks, inquiries, and push notifications strongly suggest that citizens, particularly citizens of color, can no longer realistically expect a life uncaptured and unprofiled when our social infrastructure is configured in the way that it is.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>However, we can also imagine and seek evidence of other possible computations; we can find examples of local ownership of community data centers, a decentralized web or an internet built differently, advocacy groups using data on individual interactions with firms, states, and others to demonstrate harm, or data deployed to effect emancipatory political change. We can also remember that as pervasive as the surveillant apparatus is, enormous infrastructural systems are subject to breakage. If we are surveilled from amorphous watchtowers in the cloud, these are often staffed by fallible fortune-tellers; numerate fortune-tellers that sometimes aid and sometimes foil the scientific manager. Which is not to say that the situation any less dire; only that we’ll find no way forward in the thicket of careless determinism.</p>
    <p>Thus, somewhere in between the apocalyptic and salvific, it surely must be possible to locate an image of urban computation that is more open for action and intervention—in other words, something a bit more realistic. We might a ‘stubbornly realist attitude’ in Latour’s neo-pragmatic parlance.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> We might adopt strong objectivity, in Harding’s feminist analysis,<span class="citation"><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> that remembers the situatedness of its knowledge, as in Haraway and those writing in her wake.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span> A ‘technopositional’ stance.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span> Can urbanists and technologists take computation seriously—which is to say avoid giving into to the twinned perils of technophobia and technophilia? Can we better ‘care for the subject,’<span class="citation"><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span>, willing and able to give it our attention.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span> This collection of essays articulates a hopeful and critical ‘yes’, staking out a position that is simultaneously optimistic about the affordances and critically attuned to the problematics of algorithmic life, big data, new spatial media, smart cities, and environmental monitoring.</p>
    <h2 id="disciplinary-futures">Disciplinary Futures</h2>
    <p>Such a stance is demanded by changes within our institution. In June of this past summer, MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning announced the launch of a new undergraduate major in ‘urban science.’<span class="citation"><a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> <em>Wired</em> was predictably excited. “It is not so often that a major university like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology discovers a new kind of science.” Over a breathless three pages describing the possibilities of urban science, urban informatics, and spatial science, Aarian Marshall traces a ‘budding discipline’ through the office spaces of the Bay Area and the halls of government where a shared agenda is emerging around how to leverage big spatial data to fill political imaginations, server farms, and coffers at one and the same time.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>The MIT DUSP Twitter account sunnily shared the article, quoting the article’s lede, which was also its hubristic peak: ‘a new kind of science.’<span class="citation"><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span> Academic Twitter was predictably unamused.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Carrie Mott (@<a href="https://twitter.com/mott_carrie">mott_carrie</a>), a geographer at the University of Louisville, asks: “Did you not realize there is an entire field called urban geography? This is nothing new…” Renee Sieber (@<a href="https://twitter.com/re_sieber">re_sieber</a>), a GIScientist at McGill University, wields Rittel and Webber:<span class="citation"><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></span> “‘Hello MIT, I’d like to introduce to wicked problems…’ Also, urban science–the marriage of politics to civic processes–is not novel–see NYU.”<span class="citation"><a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>Of course, it was June; high time for academics to manufacture controversies that might distract from their frustrating inability to meet writing goals that seemed so realistic in May. (What’s that? Who’s projecting?) Furthermore, criticizing an academic program for being ahistorical on the basis of an article in a magazine renowned for its self-parodic ahistoricism hardly seems fair.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></span> Finally, couldn’t we reasonably respond that it is more than a bit nonsensical to treat the positions of an academic department’s Twitter account as equivalent to those held by its faculty? Let they whose department would not share and retweet cast the first stone.</p>
    <p>But words have power, particularly when tied to institutions, and I would argue that we have a responsibility to our critics. Words have power to reshape disciplinary discourse, funding priorities, methodological allowances, pedagogical approaches, and the like. This is, of course, not automatic—witness the difficulty with which a brief ‘quantitative revolution’ emerged within human geography in the 1960s, piecemeal and contested<span class="citation"><a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></span> or the periodic flourishing and subsequent periodic decline of urban modeling in planning discourse.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></span> MIT, though, is somewhat unusual in its ability to usurp disciplinary norms. We could point to the MIT planning department known by Donald Schon, and the disciplinary influence of his insistence on reflexive ethics in practice.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span> Or we could point, more recently, to its realization of the seemingly impossible: seeing its sociology department skyrocket to the top of a <em>Center for Public Anthropology</em> ranking of “Faculty Media Impact”: this was in spite of the fact that MIT has no sociology department.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>The point is that within an institution holding unusual clout, we have a responsibility to hear our critics and to remember our history. We have been here before; this is demonstrated by histories of urban media<span class="citation"><a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></span> and urban computational expertise<span class="citation"><a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span>… though, as usual, ‘here’ is different than it once was. Frederic Jameson’s somewhat paradoxical reminder to ‘always historicize’<span class="citation"><a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></span> cannot be taken to imply that historicizing always makes the same demands.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></span> It does not imply that the present always looks the same in the light of history. But it does suggest that history might be the best method for insuring that a turn towards urban science does not erode our commitment tothen anti-technocratic politics that is the planning discipline’s hardest-won inheritance from the second half of the twentieth century (even if the victory was always far from complete).</p>
    <h2 id="seminars-and-slowness">Seminars and Slowness</h2>
    <p>This mess of words before you is the product of one semester spent taking time to remember our history and think through the implications of the work we do. We gathered together in a space structured according to the hoariest academic format: the seminar. We took as our starting point Shannon Mattern’s essay ‘A City is Not a Computer,’ which analyzes the most recent renewal of computational language in city planning and professional urbanism, placing it in a longer (and medially far richer) historical arc.<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Beyond the nevertheless important reminder that what appears new rarely is, Mattern’s piece holds that responsible political life keeps in mind <em>both</em> the frailty and the force of its models. “[The practice of debunking metaphors] matters because the metaphors give rise to technical models, which inform design processes, which in turn shape knowledges and politics, not to mention material cities.”<span class="citation"><a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></span> Obviously false, but nevertheless effectual. Our words matter and materialize. And our descriptions of our actions, of our disciplines, and of our projects are not innocent or inactive. Describing the world in a certain way can make it so. Holding a statement to be true has effects.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></span> Describing populations makes new people.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></span> Creating a category changes the world.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></span> Describing our cities computationally has a way of orienting our practices of governance and design towards calculability.</p>
    <p>In short, we spent half of an academic year repeatedly encountering the confounding problem that our technologies are both less efficacious than the technologist would have us believe, and far more impactful than the scientist would represent. Our technologies are both <em>powerful</em> and <em>inadequate</em>, having effects even as these are not equivalent to their inputs.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></span> Given the wide remit of this animating problematic, it should not be a surprise that the essays and projects cover a great deal of ground, drawing on primary source research, visual and archival methods, and a broad collection of theoretical resources and case studies drawn from human geography, science and technology studies, and cultural theory.</p>
    <dl>
    <dt>Daniel Engelberg</dt>
    <dd>...presents us with a social and legal history of land use and transportation interaction models, arguing that we can look to their presence in the legal record for evidence that boundary objects provide usefully shifting ground for conflict and contestation.
    </dd>
    <dt>Adrianna Boghozian</dt>
    <dd>...examines citizen sensing and mobile alert systems, engaging with questions of attention and efficacy to articulate a vision for dispersed alert systems that meaningfully shift individual action in response to environmental hazards.
    </dd>
    <dt>Jay Dev</dt>
    <dd>...seeks to distill a framework for meaningful participation into parts of the data life cycle that often go untouched by discourses of democratization–namely, analysis–teasing out wisdom from case studies and aligned disciplinary experiments in participatory methods.
    </dd>
    <dt>Maia Woluchem</dt>
    <dd>...asks after the alternative ontologies enabled by legislative and policy change, subsequently asking the more difficult question: even when categories change our political imagination, how are these imaginations constrained by the power to make information actionable?
    </dd>
    <dt>Arianna Salazar Miranda</dt>
    <dd>...creates a graphic representation of the professional networks growing up around cybernetic expertise, particularly as its influence began to infiltrate the design disciplines in the postwar era.
    </dd>
    <dt>Agnes Cameron</dt>
    <dd>...issues something of an ethical manifesto for computational care, arguing that the internet could be more like a garden - something to tend, maintain, and attend to by cultivating its idiosyncratic places as objects of care.
    </dd>
    <dt>Dylan Halpern</dt>
    <dd>...constructs an index of contemporary motifs for our pervasively mediated and monitored present, producing a suggestive diagram of our discourse that rearticulates common and uncommon language in an effort to make it slightly stranger and more hyperactive in its associations.
    </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>These essays, taken together, should remind us of both the peril and the prospect of urban computation, its history and its present, its power and its fragility. As Daston and Galison remind us, to place modes of knowledge production in a historical context is not to suggest that they produce falsehoods or idealogical masks; it is to grant them a richer life in our political and disciplinary imaginations, to allow us to be differently responsible to their maintenance and care.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></span></p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>At the end of the semester, I placed all of the writing produced by seminar participants into a training dataset and fed it to a neural network. The title of this volume, and of this short essay, is drawn from a passage produced by a machine doing its best impression of our work together. The training dataset was relatively small (37,732 words), so forgive its difficulty with the rules of grammar and punctuation. I draw it because I hold it to be evocative of what is at stake. Data plays… and plays out. Louise Amoore points out that though debates around ‘big data’, ‘dataveillance’, and the like tend to cluster around the language of privacy, violations of this type are not the greatest danger. Rather, it is that decisions are made on the basis of poor models constructed from discriminatory representations of individual actions. It’s not the individual that is the target of contemporary surveillance; it is the dividual, the data derivative, the shadow of the self that governing bodies create - data left to play.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>On the other hand, play is, I’d like to think, a good working description of our time together this semester. We rolled ideas back and forth; we dared to toss around fragile concepts; we gave notions time and space to wander; we toyed with textual evidence (which, lest we forget, is data, too), evaluating arguments for and against the efficacy of computational methods in the urban disciplines. If only for two hours every week, we allowed ourselves a bit of slowness in which our current moment could play with the past. We thought about how we might enact our projects differently having taken a longer view than often feels permitted within the professionalized university (or to succumb to a critical-theoretical temptation: the neoliberal university). The Data plays for a day, and my hope is that this play reverberates; at the very least, we take the step of recording it in this artifact, an archive of positions taken during a small amount of time spent pausing and playing, together.</p>
