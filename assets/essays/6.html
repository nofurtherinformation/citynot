<p>You would be forgiven for feeling that the future of computing looks bleak.</p>

<p>Where the internet was once a lively proliferation of different websites, 70% of web traffic is now routed through sites belonging to Facebook and Google (CITE Stalz). Much of the computation performed on our phones and computers is mediated by apps, the operation of which is often obfuscated and proprietary, the privacy settings murky. Tech monopolies are moving computation rapidly into physical space: from Amazon’s Alexa robot, a recent patent for which included a detector for ‘abnormal physical or emotional conditions’ as a marketing tool (CITE patent), to Google’s Sidewalk Labs, whose promise to craft a city ‘from the internet up’, powers a vast private data collection programme (CITE Mattern).  These systems blur the line between public and private, the commons and the corporate, using the language of openness and democracy whilst embodying neither (CITE Shaw, Graham, Srnicek). Moreover, the underpaid, and difficult maintenance work that maintains these systems -- sanitation workers, Amazon’s fulfillment centre staff, Facebook’s content moderators, employees at Google’s vast server farms, factory workers in Shenzhen -- are increasingly obscured from view.</p>

<p>
A system cannot remain a black box if one is to care for it. As black-boxed and opaque computational systems increasingly permeate public space, what tools do we have to change that space through changing computation? How do we make legible the maintenance work required to regulate these systems, and come to engage with it ourselves?  What other possibilities are offered in computing history, and how might we construct a different future?

In this essay, I trace ideas of the computer in its relation to the city in terms of care and maintenance, and the collective production of space. Here, I take ‘the computer’ to refer to what media theorist Alexander Galloway calls the ‘informatic machine’ (CITE Galloway), an infrastructure, or set of processes that deal with “information”: “any difference which makes a difference in some later event” (CITE Bateson 1972). This definition is intentionally broad, ranging across the global (the internet), the local (your mobile phone), the abstract (neural networks), and the mechanical (the loom). 

From this definition, I will first explore some alternate histories to the computer as a ‘control system’. Second, I will focus more specifically on the cybernetic ideal of self-regulation, and tie it to concurrent narratives of maintenance and care. Third, I will consider computational ideas of participation within urban systems. Ultimately, I want to move beyond the critique of ideas of ‘the city as computer’, and look instead at how we might open up computation to include the kinds of labour so lacking in the ‘cybernetic ideal’ Google invites us to inhabit.

control systems
“contrary to media theorist Marshall McLuhan’s insistence that media is an extension of man, the internet—a paradigmatic example of media—has become an extension of control.”
Zach Blas

Many histories of computing centre on a narrative that cycles in a tight loop between military and corporate interests. This is, after all, an approximately linear and tractable route back from where we find ourselves today: a world that has seen the blossoming of corporate giants (Facebook, Amazon, Google, then Apple, Microsoft) built on innovation from utopian, partially DARPA-funded laboratories (Xerox PARC, the Media Lab, Bell Labs), which themselves were populated by many of the men and inventions that sprung from two World Wars’ worth of military-industrial investment (CITE Light).

The field of Cybernetics has its roots in Norbert Wiener’s design of an Anti-Aircraft gun, and Information Theory (a precursor to the modern science of communications) in Claude Shannon’s work on wartime cryptography. The Internet itself was prefigured by ARPAnet, a military defence programme inspired by Viet Cong tactics of distribution and dispersal (CITE Plant, Gerovich). Jennifer Light traces a history of the ‘smart city’ to the mid-1960’s, where these technologies were applied to the city to ‘wage war’ on domestic urban crises.


everything is deeply intertwingled
The narrative of the computer as a system of control is well-grounded in our present condition, subject as we are to corporate mass-surveillance, creeping automation, and the erosion of civil liberties. However, I argue that we’re doing a disservice to computers, to their history (and, crucially to ourselves) if this is the only trajectory we chart. As Doreen Massey writes on globalisation in her book For Space: “the cosmology of ‘only one narrative’ obliterates the multiplicities, the contemporaneous heterogeneities of space”, a pernicious ‘sleight of hand’ that convinces us of the inevitability of a particular path. Indeed, as Sadie Plant notes in Zeroes and Ones, it is the very nature of computation that merits a non-linear history, based as it is in “a process which simultaneously assembles and dismantles the route back to the start, the end, the future, the past”. 

Ted Nelson’s Computer Lib/Dream Machines, published in 1974 (a year before the first Personal Computer, and decades before the first webpage), forms a manifesto for a different kind of computation. “You can and must understand computers NOW!”, the cover insists. Nelson also introduced the idea of hypertext, the linking-together of digital text through references, coining the phrase “Everything is deeply intertwingled”. Nelson imagined hypertext fundamentally as a ‘2-way, visible connection’, an ideal he sees as betrayed by Tim Berners-Lee’s eventual implementation of HTML in 1989 (which became the World Wide Web), in which connections between information are unidirectional. Jarod Lanier remarks that “It's a small, simple change in how online information should be stored that couldn't have vaster implications for culture and the economy”.

Over a century before that, Ada Lovelace had declared that “all and everything is naturally related and interconnected”. Plant notes that her ideas are often thought of has coming far too early,”works of genius so untimely as to be more or less irrelevant to the course of machines”. In fact, Plant observes that technical developments are “rarely simple matters of cause and effect”. As Lovelace herself declared: "That Brain of mine is something more than merely mortal; as time will show.'' 

making a warm machine
“The computer is an incredible projective test: what you see in the computer 
comes right off the back wall of your psyche.” — Ted Nelson

Bristol Robotics Lab might not, outwardly, seem like the place to be thinking about philosophy. The building is a huge warehouse next to an airport, decorated at the entrance with 2 ornamental robot arms, its interior divided into 3x3 metre cubes filled with machinery. The lab houses plenty of the things that you might expect (manufacturing, drone swarms) but it is also home to the Artificial Culture Project, which studies the emergence of culture among social robots. This project, and others, come out of the research of Alan Winfield, a professor of robot ethics who works on, amongst other things, a robot theory of mind. This intelligence is articulated in the ‘consequence engine’, a simulation-based internal model that builds an internal model of others around it.  In writing about this work, Winfield invokes a conversation with Neuropsychologist Richard Gregory: "when your robots start telling each other stories, then you'll really be onto something".

Winfield’s work seeks to understand intelligences as embodied and situated within agents, not in the service of humans, but for their own sake. This work plays on the distinction between ‘The Machine’ and ‘Warm Human Being’, a divide critiqued by Nelson as promulgated by ‘rigid, narrow, and inflexible people’, more a reflection of themselves than any strict idea of computation.


caring for and about machines
“Attention is care. And there is much to care about!” — Matthew Wilson

What, then, does it mean to care for a computer, or indeed any infrastructural system? Here, I take Wilson’s definition of attention as a form of care, the act of caring being at its core an act of thoughtfulness. Larissa Belcic’s project An Antidote to Loneliness outlines a set of ‘practices for technological friendship’ that seeks to pair human and non-human ecologies with parts of unloved electrical infrastructure. Much as Ada Lovelace regarded the Analytical Engine as a “friend”, Belcic advocates that technology be included as part of an ecology, rather than hidden: ‘not to improve efficiency or function but for love, friendship and well-being’.

Artist Taeyoon Choi writes about hand-making a computer as an “act of love, love for the ideas that the computer has come to embody”. Indeed, acts of craft and care in computational environments are not new: for the better part of computing history, people used computers by making them. The explosion of new sites in the early days of the web is often the subject of nostalgia: the joy of maintaining one’s MySpace or Geocities page, like tending to a garden. Of course, as Mattern reminds us, acts of care and maintenance are political, and not to be mistaken for altruism (CITE Mattern). The choice of whether (or not) to care exists along gendered, racialised, social, and geographical lines, and in relation to a broad set of infrastructures.


cybernetic maintenance
“Move slow and fix things” — McKenzie Wark
“The truth is that computation has, from the very start, been built to rot.”
-- Bruce Sterling


self-regulating systems

A foundational idea in cybernetics is that of “negative feedback as a fundamental mode of self-regulation” (CITE Gerovich), exemplified in William Ross Ashby’s image of the homeostat, an electromechanical apparatus built as a demonstration of how an organism maintains ‘homeostasis’ — stability in light of environmental disruption. Homeostasis was originally a word applied only to living matter (CITE Alise); in Ashby’s invocation of the homeostatic machine, this form of stability became something that one could design for.

This idea of self-regulation is a central aesthetic of computation, one that belies the constant upkeep required to maintain an appearance of seamless functionality. The ‘clean’, ‘transparent’ interface perfected by the iPhone, for example -- a technology ‘built to disappear’ -- displaces a deeply material reality. Jay Owens writes on this dissonance, tracing the physical ‘dust’ associated with the most apparently ‘dustless’ surfaces: from the toxic dust created by the fine milling of aluminium cases, to the suffocating smog of mountains of e-waste accumulated in Ghana, Thailand and Hong Kong.

This control-loop ideal — of cycles of perturbation and feedback response resulting in eventual stability — permeated a number of disciplines, not least that of architecture and urban design. The architect Christopher Alexander was particularly inspired by this ideal of homeostasis, expressing design problems as the “actions of a series of subsystems”. As Keller Easterling put it, the projects of Alexander and his colleague Cedric Price were “on the threshold of designing an architecture that has become information”.

Perhaps one of the most striking historical visions of the smart city in its adherence to cybernetic ideals is the Architecture Machine Group’s project SEEK, which sought to build a direct feedback loop between a set of urban inhabitants (a swarm of gerbils) and a benevolent automated environment. The system was made with the idea that the gerbil would learn how its behaviour affected the motion of the machine, and react accordingly. That the gerbils were none too amused with the system has remained something of a side note. 

urban homeostasis

Another meme of the self-regulating system is the black box: an abstraction of a system to a set of inputs and outputs, that renders opaque it’s inner workings. URBAN 5, another of the Architecture Machine group’s Computer Aided Urban Design tools, was termed by Jonathan Barnett “the most spectacular example of blackboxmanship”; pointing to an interface that abstracted away much of the ‘friction of the real world’ (Scott). This idea has persisted: in a 2010 lecture, Alex Galloway declared that ‘there is a new political posture today… with an acute black-box profile’, a commentary on the extent to which political decision-making is obfuscated behind an appearance of simplicity. 

In this sense, the city as computer becomes a useful metaphor. The idea that one can create a complex system based on an initially simple set of rules (Conway’s Game of Life is perhaps the most widely-used example of this), starts to feed a notion that every complex system is reducible to a simple rule-set, if only that set of rules can be found. (Cite Mattern, Light, Gabrys) These images of self-regulation smoothly translate from the human-scale (the ‘user’ of the urban environment) directly into governance, feeding back and adjusting to suit the needs of urban inhabitants.

The actually-existing city, of course, regulates itself through different kind of feedback: the labour of postal workers, street cleaners, bus drivers, and traffic wardens. However, as Mattern reminds us: “we have to recognize that maintenance and repair have always been shaped by the political, social, cultural, and ecological contexts of technology”. As the city becomes ‘smarter’, this work does not disappear, but it is changed. Ted Nelson remarks: ‘there is no such thing as "fully" computerized. There is always one more thing computers could do.’

the girl in the machine

The tricky politics of maintenance and the interface plague the ideal of cybernetic governance. Stafford Beer’s Cybersyn project — an attempt at data-driven, bottom-up socialism in Allende’s Chile used, as a central image, a ‘control room’ that rendered Chile’s production data legible and accessible to all. As Medina notes in her account of the project: “the clean, futuristic appearance of the control room obscured the vast network of individuals, materials, expertise, and information required to make economic management appear simple”. Using the hidden labour of (female) graphic designers, complex charts were made navigable by a few buttons, eliminating the “girl between themselves and the machinery” — the female typist who would normally navigate this information (CITE Medina).

Sadie Plant remarks that “before their beginnings and beyond their ends, women have been the simulators, assemblers and programmers of the digital machines”, She sees the work of computation as fundamentally linked to the practice of weaving, not just as a mode of information processing (the loom as a processor, the fabric as memory), and as a physical precursor to mechanical computers, but also a practice that has created a set of social relations re-created by women in the service of digital systems today. In all these cases, the “means of communication begin to communicate with themselves”.

This ideal of weaving as social computation comes up in multiple places. Bret Victor’s Dynamicland project -- a social computer that is programmed using paper and pens -- evokes the knitting circle as a form of co-creation central to his vision of a ‘new kind of computer’. Suzanne Lacy’s artwork The Crystal Quilt uses the collective computation of quilting as a performance, bringing together 430 women over the age of 60 to share their views on ageing, while following a collective protocol that produced a patterned quilt (CITE TATE). These projects centre the kind of caring labour (for one another, for the system) that is normally ignored by the language of ‘innovation’, but happens all the same.


care, attention, repair

“After the revolution, who takes out the trash on Monday morning” 
— Mierle Ukeles
 Maintenance is innovation made personal, it is also innovation made social. -- Ezra Teboul

There are many places where the systems ideal of self-regulation disconnects with its ‘real-world’ manifestation as maintenance labour, but perhaps none so much as in waste and sanitation. If waste is information (CITE Offenhuber), then what does it mean that we obscure this information from view? As Mattern remarks on the ‘smart’ waste chutes installed at the Hudson Yards development: “[they] cultivate an out-of-sight, out-of-mind public consciousness… garbage becomes more of a domestic aesthetic problem than an ecological concern.” She asks instead whether the designers might provide a view of the “smart, efficient” waste collection system, making legible the infrastructure of disposal.

The art of Mierle Ukeles has for decades centered waste. Her Manifesto for Maintenance Art (1969) is a critique of the ‘Death Instinct’ of the Avant-Garde “to follow one’s own path to death—do your own thing; dynamic change”, in comparison to the unifying and perpetual act of maintenance. In her works, she encourages visitors to observe and participate in waste systems, in durational pieces where she would bring in containers of refuse to the gallery and ‘purify’ them over the course of an exhibition. In proposing a project for the Fresh Kills landfill site in 2001, she terms it “a true social sculpture composed of 150 million tons from literally billions of individual decisions and acts of rejection.” 

What is the computational analogue of these sites of disposal? One could, as artist Hito Steyerl remarks, consider the endless cycle of spam as a circulation of discarded ‘poor’ images, the “trash that washes up on digital economies’ shores” (CITE Steyerl).  Is it the ‘mass of dead and broken links’ decried by Ted Nelson as the product of one-directional hypertext? Maybe it is the subjects of Bruce Sterling’s Dead Media Project, a collection of obsolete information technologies ranging from the Incan qipu to the IBM Letterwriter (itself, ironically, now a dead link maintained by the Internet Archive) (CITE Sterling). Perhaps it is, as Jennifer Gabrys describes, landfills themselves -- built up from the global circulation of e-waste from constant cycles of ‘innovation’, Ukeles’ death instinct alive and well (CITE Gabrys).

In reading these collective ‘social sculptures’ as the products of complex information systems that we do not care for, how do we come to engage these systems? Should we even be obliged to? In acknowledging the individual futility of recycling, waste scholar Max Liborion reminds us that ‘even if individual actions don’t save the world, they are expressions of an ethic that can lead to other actions that do scale.’ This ethic: of care, of attention, is key in engaging these systems past symbolic participation.


(co)computing as maintenance work

"Discos are more fun than dancing alone" — Bret Victor


In Waste is Information, Offenhuber examines the role of interfaces between citizens and governments in ‘participatory’ waste collection systems, making the argument that the politics of representation of a system require a set of common protocols. He critiques the notion of decentralisation for decentralisation’s sake, arguing that the fragmentation of urban services can create the kind of inequality it might purport to dynamically address. Shaw and Graham, too, warn against an uncritical ideal of urban participation, arguing that: “‘Openness', ‘democracy’, ‘user-feedback’ and ‘participation’ are all part of the mode of governance for informational capitalism—it is precisely the invitation to behave as an individual that reproduces the power in the hands of an elite.”

Nascent ‘alternative’ narratives of computation are increasingly centred around the co-creation of a common space, and seeing oneself as a part of a system (rather than an observer or user) (CITE, Taeyoon, SFPC, Dynamicland, Schwulst). From the peer-to-peer web to Victor’s Dynamicland, utopian visions of future computing infrastructure centre an ideal of participation. In a critique of an overly-simplistic invocation of ‘P2P socialism’, Ulises Ali Mejias states that  “Despite capitalism’s attempts to expropriate them, the new models of collaboration opened up by P2P can be fruitful if they are converted into authentic political platforms that revitalize the public sphere. P2P does not have to be a ‘publicness without a public sphere.’”

feeling, being the new computer

“More autogestion, less autosuggestion!” 
— Joe Shaw and Mark Graham

In her essay My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?, artist and designer Laurel Schwulst argues for the artist website as a means of reclaiming the web. This is in direct response to the reducing of the web to a set of sanitised platforms, a reaction to the real difficulty inherent in spontaneously naming a website that isn’t Facebook, Google, Twitter or YouTube. She argues that simply by having an ‘artist website’ — by becoming an active part of the infrastructure — you undertake “an individual act of collective ambition”. Schwulst’s imaginary of the web is figured heavily in terms of maintenance. The language she uses: tending, cultivating, metaphors of websites as houses and gardens, centre careful, thoughtful development as a form of civic computation. 

Shaw and Graham, too, advocate for a techno-future in which “We must actively enjoy the practice of producing and managing our urban information.”, and of “actively living with the digital information we produce”. This vision -- and the visions of P2P projects such as Dat and IPFS -- might be utopian, but it acknowledges the role of care in producing change. Within the ideal of homeostasis, Christopher Alexander understood the need for maintenance alongside the creation of the new: “when you build a thing you cannot merely build that thing in isolation, but must repair the world around it, and within it, so that the larger world at that one place becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the thing which you make takes its place in the web of nature, as you make it.”


Reappearing act
“...most important things want to remain invisible: Love is invisible. 
War is invisible. Capital is invisible.”.
-Hito Steyerl

In a speech to the 2015 World Economic Forum, chairman of Alphabet Inc. (née Google) Eric Schmidt declared that “the Internet will disappear”. He seems not to be the only one in on this vanishing act: in recent years, we have been promised a host of disappearances, not least the iPhone, which envisions a product “so immersive the device itself disappears into the experience.” (CITE iPhone X). These products will not, of course, go away -- instead, as Zach Blas points out “...to disappear the internet is to dissolve its infrastructures into the very materialities that compose contemporary life and the world.”

In Situated Knowledges, Haraway underlines the importance of vision, both as a tool of oppression and a tool of resistance. Seeing everything is, of course, impossible: a ‘god trick’. But within a “particular and specific embodiment”, vision allows us to “become answerable for what we learn how to see”. If participation in a system is an act of care, then seeing that system: the garbage truck, the ‘dusty’ iPhone screen, the HTML is a means by which one can participate.
