<h1 class="title">an incomplete motif index of the technological and the urban</h1>
<p class="author">Dylan Halpern</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This index surveys and describes key themes in critical theory on technology, society, and city. Pointing to ideas as far back as Foucault, this document aims to provide a brief, accessible editorial of motifs from critical geography, planning, visualization, and Science and Technology Studies (STS). Accompanying this paper is a circuit diagram that links and spatializes the ideas included within.</p>

<h4 id="section">2.0</h4>
<p>2.0 is a suffix that denotes a second version of an idea, technology, or method. It is rooted in and references digital technologies and their versions indicated with numeric decimals (e.g. Firefox version 60.3.0, browser at time of writing). 2.0 came to prominence in the 2000s as digital culture became mainstream; Darcy DiNucci’s coining of Web 2.0<span class="citation" data-cites="dinucci_fragmentedfuture_1999"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> and O’Reilly’s<span class="citation" data-cites="oreilly_web_2"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> subsequent usage was an early indicator of the 2.0 nomenclature to come. For a more complete history of Web 2.0, see Cristina Aced’s<span class="citation" data-cites="toledano_weborigin_2013"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> “Web 2.0: the origin of the word that has changed the way we understand public relations.” Now, 2.0 points to a cheap bravado and superficially technicality standing in for evolution; post is currently the preferred scholarly affix to connote evolution.</p>
<p>On the renaissance of “post-” prefixes: Trevor Barnes analyzes “post-” as a reminder to: 1) critically examine disciplinary origins, power, and assumptions; 2) consider non-Western or “other” conceptions within a given discipline, and; 3) reiterate the importance of political practice within a discipline.<span class="citation" data-cites="kelly_logicsdislocation_2008"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
<h4 id="affect-affective-rationality">Affect, affective rationality</h4>
<p>As an element of feminist theory, affect traces an inquiry into emotions. Affect explores, implicates, or interrogates on the role of emotions, simple or complex, in our experiences, ethics, thoughts, and decisions. Increasing in popularity over the past two decades, questions of affect call into question ‘residual cultural Cartesianism’<span class="citation" data-cites="thrift_intensitiesfeeling_2004"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span>,<span class="citation" data-cites="thien_feelingconsideration_2005"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> that has heretofore excluded substantive considerations of feeling and reason. Deborah Thein<span class="citation" data-cites="thien_feelingconsideration_2005"><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> traces this turn across disciplines:</p>
<p>“Social, cultural and feminist geographers (Bondi 1999 forthcoming; Wood 2002; Airey 2003; Bodi and Fewell 2003; Callard 2003; Thrift 2004), cultural and gender theorists (Chodorow 1999; Ahmed 2002 2004; Harding and Pribram 2002; Sedgwick 2003), philosophers (Nussbaum 2001), sociologists (Jamieson 1998; Hochschild 2000 2003; Williams 2001; Fortier 2003); those in the psychological disciplines (Matthis 2000; Blackman 2004) and neuroscientists (Damasio 2000)…”</p>
<p>Deborah Thein, “After or beyond Feeling? A Consideration of Affect and Emotion in Geography”, 2004 (p.450)<span class="citation" data-cites="thien_feelingconsideration_2005"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>

<p>Brian Massumi, for example, theorizes “affective rationality” or “affective fact” – a concept of codifying perception into fact, and sometimes reality, based on feelings and intuitions.<span class="citation" data-cites="bryant_digitalother_2010"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
<p>“…the dynamical object exclaimed by the sign of alarm, is nothing other than the dynamic form of the body at this instant of reawakening to its world on alert, imperatively altering….Fire or no fire, transition to and through alert is made.”</p>
<p>Brian Massumi, “The Future Birth Of The Affective Fact: The Political Ontology Of Threat” In Digital And Other Virtualities: Renegotiating The Image, 2010 (p.90)<span class="citation" data-cites="bryant_digitalother_2010"><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<h4 id="ambividuals">Ambividuals</h4>
<p>Jennifer Gabrys succinctly describes ambividuals as, “ambient and malleable urban operators that are expressions of computer environments” (p.42).<span class="citation" data-cites="gabrys_programmingenvironments_2014"><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span> Applicable to human or machine agents, Gabrys proposes this concept as an alternative to assertions that smart cities point towards a dissolution of individualism.<span class="citation" data-cites="gabrys_programmingenvironments_2014"><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> Rather, the ambividual descends from a Foucauldian bloodline, pointing towards environmentality, probabilistic articulations of subjectivity, and the real-time siting of subject through omnipresent sensors.<span class="citation" data-cites="gabrys_programmingenvironments_2014"><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>
<h4 id="binary">Binary</h4>
<p>Binary may refer to a two-state definition often represented as 1 or 0: on and off, female and male, good and evil. In electronics, this distinction is recorded by magnetic states in hard drive platters, charge status in Flash memory and other semiconductors, and polarity in electron memory storage. Catherine D’Ignazio reminds us of the centrality of challenging binaries to feminist theory; she traces the “disavowal of binary distinctions” across dichotomies of “nature and culture [37], subject and object [43], reason and emotion [54], and body and world [4], among many others”<span class="citation" data-cites="dignazio_feministdata_"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span>,(p.2). “…don’t be evil…” - Google (Alphabet) Code of Conduct, Updated July 31, 2018<span class="citation" data-cites="alphabet_alphabetinvestor_2018"><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Binary may also be a mode of counting alternative to decimal. 1, 10, buckle my shoe 11, 100, shut the door 101, 110, pick up sticks 111, 1000, lay them straight 1001, 1010, begin again</p>
<p>Binary is also a significant concept for the work of Claude Shannon. Shannon theorized a mode of information conveyance through an abstracted numerical form – the binary system.<span class="citation" data-cites="shannon_mathematicaltheory_1948"><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></span> Shannon’s work has been foundational in the abstraction of information into code and programming languages, coining the word “bits” as an abbreviation for “binary digits.”;<span class="citation" data-cites="shannon_mathematicaltheory_1948"><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span>(p.1)</p>
<h4 id="biometric-consciousness">Biometric Consciousness</h4>
<p>Biometric Consciousness refers to a critical practice and thinking for biometric data on the human body and the individual.<span class="citation" data-cites="browne_darkmatters_2015a"><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></span> Simone Browne conceptualizes critical biometric consciousness as a method “to situate certain biometric information technologies as techniques through which the cultural production of race can be understood,”<span class="citation" data-cites="browne_darkmatters_2015a"><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></span>(p.116). Browne characterizes critical biometric consciousness as a forum for encouraging public discourse on topics including:</p>
<p>Accountability of data ownership and capture The manufacture of technology, particularly on mineral extraction and labor Fallibility of biometric technology and its probabilistic methods Connections of biometric systems to past technologies, histories Exclusion based on failure to enroll errors Addressing “our linked subjectivity” and responsibilities to and from one another</p>
<h4 id="black-box">Black Box</h4>
<p>Frank Pasquale characterizes a black box as a closed system whose results are so patently true and confident that we needn’t question it .<span class="citation" data-cites="pasquale_blackbox_2015"><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></span> “Who refers to Lavoisier’s paper when writing the formula H2O for water?” - Bruno Latour</p>
<p>A black box may also describe an impenetrable system from which we observe nothing but what comes in and out.</p>
<p>During the Cold War, Soviet surveillance of the Pentagon noticed a structure in the 5-acre courtyard. Every day, US officials would go to the structure empty-handed and leave with a mysterious brown bag. KGB operatives spent sleepless nights tossing and turning, wondering why the American ‘dogs’ darted to and from this cart, searching for ‘links’ that might serve as clues to what the brown bags contained. Fearing the worst, DOD lore holds that this hot spot “never had any less than two missiles aimed” at it<span class="citation" data-cites="departmentofdefense_defensegov_2015"><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span>‡.</p>
<p>In aviation, a black box is a flight recorder used to capture critical data in the event of an emergency – typically orange.</p>
<h4 id="clouds">Clouds</h4>
<p>Where stand the whereabouts of power?</p>
<p>Cloud Computing is a broad category of service delivery. It is generally constructed from a network of remote servers, rather than one locally; it is generally characterized by the vendor maintaining and managing back-end processes (e.g. “the cloud”), a pay-as-you-go pricing model, and options to scale services.<span class="citation" data-cites="techopedia_whatcloud_2018"><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In understanding today’s geopolitics, Louise Amoore argues for the importance of institutional/governmental cloud computing, examining its geography, structures, and “practices of data gathering, analysing and knowing,”<span class="citation" data-cites="amoore_cloudgeographies_2018"><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></span>(p.6). Amoore points to ICITE, a US government 17-agency cloud data repository, as an example of the technology’s significance. Such interconnectivity among data points and algorithmic learning forges new perceptions, cognitions, and probabilistic inferences.<span class="citation" data-cites="amoore_cloudgeographies_2018"><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span></p>
<p>“Cognitive computing renders perceptible to the analyst ‘what matters’ geopolitically, using the volume of cloud-based digital data precisely to reduce and flatten the field of vision….The volume is radically condensed down to the target data elements, like beaded drops on ionizing particles through which future trajectories of motion can be inferred.” Louise Amoore, “Cloud geographies: Computing, data, sovereignty”<span class="citation" data-cites="amoore_cloudgeographies_2018"><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></span>’(p.14)</p>
<p>Amoore references John Allen and his concept of whereabouts of power. He posts that the location of authority is relational.<span class="citation" data-cites="allen_whereaboutspower_2004"><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></span> It exists in a network that may or may not be centralized or decentralized. He asserts that power is formulated of media, of “territorially embedded assets and resources – of money, information, people, ideas, symbols, technologies and such…,”<span class="citation" data-cites="allen_whereaboutspower_2004"><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></span>(p.13).</p>
<p>In picnics, clouds may appear as simple aerosol masses to some, equestrian visages to a few, and breaks from the heat for others.</p>
<h4 id="codespace">code/space</h4>
<p>Rob Kitchin and Martin Dodge describe a code/space as bipartite label for the pair-bonded relationship that has flourished between computer programming and spatiality.<span class="citation" data-cites="kitchin_codespace_2011"><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></span> They are places intrinsically tied to both technology and location. Kitchin and Dodge point to retail services, networked logistics, and increasingly automated vehicles and their motorways as examples of established and emerging code/spaces.</p>
<h4 id="communicative-objectivity">Communicative Objectivity</h4>
<p>Orit Halpern describes communicative objectivity as “a radical shift in attitudes to recording and displaying information that produced new forms of observation, rationality, and economy based on the management and analysis of data.”<span class="citation" data-cites="halpern_beautifuldata_2014a"><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></span> Halpern, writing on visual artists like György Kepes, E.A.T., and others, frames communicative objectivity as a data-driven form of knowledge generation. Communicative objectivity makes and remakes facts recursively: pre, post, ad, and propter hoc. Halpern writes that the canvas for communicative objectivity is “the assumed recordability of the world,” and so we might offer sensors as its catalysts.</p>
<h4 id="critical-visualization">Critical Visualization</h4>
<p>Peter Hall outlines critical visualization as a practice of viz that challenges sensorial, cultural, and scientific assumptions.<span class="citation" data-cites="hall_criticalvisualization_2008"><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></span> Contemporary critical visualization – and its cousins, critical mapping and GIS – sidesteps dichotomies of narrative or data-driven motivations, instead creating networked, rhizomatic media that challenge information and knowledge hierarchies. These media are immediately cross and self-referential. They are multiform, interpretable, and varied.</p>
<h4 id="culture-of-simulation">Culture of Simulation:</h4>
<p>Jennifer Light describes a culture of simulation as a pointer often used to trace smart cities origins in post-war America.<span class="citation" data-cites="light_warfarewelfare_2003a"><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></span> Light attributes this term to the work of Jean Baudrillard, but she asserts that it may be deceptive. Instead, Light argues, smart city antecedents may lie “in the context of military war games and RAND and MIT…,”<span class="citation" data-cites="light_warfarewelfare_2003a"><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></span>(p.21). Simulations, alongside other military decision-making instruments re-upholstered for municipal governance, present the capacity for legitimate insight concurrent with the seduction of great simplification.</p>
<h4 id="cyborg">Cyborg</h4>
<p>Cyborg may be a portmanteau of cybernetic and organism coined by Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline.<span class="citation" data-cites="clynes_cyborgsspace_1960"><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></span> Their concept was originally proposed to enable self-regulation of the human body in deep, cold extraterrestrial travel.</p>
<p>“While it is quite difficult to set upper limits to ‘natural’ human physiological and psychological performance, we can take as minimal the capabilities demonstrated under control conditions such as yoga or hypnosis.” Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline, Cyborgs and space, 1960<span class="citation" data-cites="clynes_cyborgsspace_1960"><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></span></p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Donna Haraway’s A Cyborg Manifesto establishes cyborg as a conceptual, political, and/or social hybrid.<span class="citation" data-cites="haraway_cyborgmanifesto_2006"><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></span> The amalgam is not just of mechanism and organism in a conventional sense; Haraway’s cyborg combines real social phenomena and narrative fiction, mapped realities and imagined resources, and physical being and abstract consciousness.<span class="citation" data-cites="haraway_cyborgmanifesto_2006"><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></span> Haraway describes the cyborg as a condensed, ontological image of self meant to challenge patriarchal, white ideas of borders and silos; it encourages “pleasure in the confusion of boundaries and for responsibility in their construction,”<span class="citation" data-cites="haraway_cyborgmanifesto_2006"><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></span>(p.150). Cyborg politics represents a transgression of boundaries in sardonic, irreverent modes; it is fractured into futures of inferno and paradise, depending on your perspective.<span class="citation" data-cites="haraway_cyborgmanifesto_2006"><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></span></li>
</ol>
<p>“People are nowhere near so fluid, being both material and opaque. Cyborgs are ether, quintessence.”</p>
<p>“[W]e are living through a movement from an organic, industrial society to a polymorphous, information system – from all work to all play, a deadly game.” Donna Haraway, “A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century” 2006,<span class="citation" data-cites="haraway_cyborgmanifesto_2006"><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></span>(p. 154, 159)</p>
<p>Among the foundations for Haraway’s manifesto is Chéla Sandoval’s concept of Oppositional Consciousness. Beyond the scope of this index, Sandoval’s work is extremely relevant in tracing the genealogy of cyborgian and a few other schools thought included here. For further reading, see Oppositional Consciousness in the Postmodern World: U.S. Third World Feminism, Semiotics, and the Methodology of the Oppressed.</p>
<h4 id="data-derivative">Data Derivative</h4>
<p>Louise Amoore describes the data derivative as an amalgam of fragmented data.<span class="citation" data-cites="amoore_dataderivatives_2011a"><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></span> In making it, fragments are reconstituted and imagined into our “proclivities and potentialities.,”<span class="citation" data-cites="amoore_dataderivatives_2011a"><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></span>(p.1) Amoore suggests four fundamental elements of the data derivative: “temporalities; norm/anomaly; the virtual and the visual; and mobilities.” Utilized most frequently in security and surveillance through threat assessment and flagging, the data derivative categorizes actions and non-actions of the individual through inferential, probabilistic, normative means.<span class="citation" data-cites="amoore_dataderivatives_2011a"><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></span> Amoore points to instances of “emptying out” matter or materiality to understand the whole – this forefuns the data derivative.<span class="citation" data-cites="amoore_politicspossibility_2013"><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></span>,(p.129-154)</p>
<h4 id="data-desires">Data Desires</h4>
<h5 id="data-driven">Data-driven</h5>
<p>Data-driven processes or methods rest on seductive forms of decision making in which data points and quantitative thinking may overtake reason, community need, spatiality, or histories. These processes may be contextually useful, contextually neutral, or contextually fatal.</p>
<h5 id="data-mart">Data Mart</h5>
<p>Shannon Mattern notes data mart structures that silo and partition data access.<span class="citation" data-cites="Mattern2018Apr"><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></span> Mattern summarizes this data distribution method in her discussion of The Human Project, a New York based research project that aims to extend and improve human life through a litany of biological samples, exams, and tests from their participants.<span class="citation" data-cites="Mattern2018Apr"><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></span> In The Human Project’s data structures, researchers must provide their own biometric identifiers to access the data mart of their subjects’ blood, spit, and shit.<span class="citation" data-cites="Mattern2018Apr"><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></span></p>

<p>Digital On-Ramps is a program in Philadelphia spurred by IBM’s 2011 Smarter Cities Challenge.<span class="citation" data-cites="shelton_actuallyexisting_2015"><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></span> It is a “collaborative effort of a network of agencies and employers” that aims to provide inclusive education tools for people at the margins and lacking literacy.<span class="citation" data-cites="shelton_actuallyexisting_2015"><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></span> As of 2018, DOR has failed to meet its goals to inspire new advanced manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and petroleum refining jobs.</p>

Shelton, Zook, and Wiig closely tie many purported data-driven smart city solutions with techno-solutionism; frequently, they are shallow promotional initiatives, seductive imaginaries for the city, and, ultimately, insufficient attempts at promoting equity.</p>
<h4 id="environmentality">Environmentality</h4>
<p>Environmentality is a new mode of state governance realized by Jennifer Gabrys<span class="citation" data-cites="gabrys_programmingenvironments_2014a"><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></span> after Michel Foucault’s<span class="citation" data-cites="foucault_birthbiopolitics_2010"><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></span> concept footnoted in The Birth of Biopolitics. Gabrys outlines this vision of power as existing through and within “specific spatial-material distribution and relationality of power through environments, technologies, and ways of life”<span class="citation" data-cites="gabrys_programmingenvironments_2014a"><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></span>,(p.30). The everyday matter and interrelations between spaces, technologies, and life are channels for environmentality to exhibit power; what’s more, it exists within those spaces, technologies, and lives – its presence is somewhere between imbued and inherent.</p>
<p>Based in Foucault’s biopolitics and applied diversely, environmentality indicates a shift in supervision strategy from a focus on subjects (the players) to one of environment (rules of the game),<span class="citation" data-cites="gabrys_programmingenvironments_2014a"><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></span>(p.34). Gabrys’s assessment of environmentality points towards state governance of and through patterns of life; her portrait of power is probabilistic rather than defined.</p>
<p>Applied to the smart city, we might understand environmentality less to do with surveillance technologies per se, but more with the implications of “urban dwellers within specific performances of citizenship,”<span class="citation" data-cites="gabrys_programmingenvironments_2014a"><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></span>(p.37). People in the city are liable to be bound up with “spatial and material” programmatic decisions that bind them to the power of technology in the environment in order to animate and realize civic acts,<span class="citation" data-cites="gabrys_programmingenvironments_2014a"><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></span>(p.37).</p>
<p>“Armed with the first photos of the earth in space, many people began rethinking their foundational images of the planet in the late 1960s. As the Earth was enveloped for the first time in photography, bringing it under control, into focus, and within reach for ordinary human beings, mythologies changed….the worldwatching project begins, turning photographic images into political practices and ideological ideals aimed at environing Nature by disciplining its spaces.”</p>

<h4 id="fourth-utility">Fourth Utility</h4>
<p>The fourth utility is a concept of incorporating broadband internet service to codified utilities – water, heat/gas, electricity. It is motivated by the desire to make information more accessible and to make the internet more like a horizontal plane – at present, it is not.</p>
<h4 id="gaia">Gaia</h4>
<p>The Gaia Hypothesis from James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis asserts that the Earth as a planet possesses unmanaged, self-regulating dynamic systems.<span class="citation" data-cites="latour_facinggaia_2017"><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></span> These systems are described physiologically, and normative claims indicate that the Earth ought to be acknowledged and respected in order to maintain our own ecological responsibility and survival.<span class="citation" data-cites="latour_facinggaia_2017"><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></span></p>
<p>“In truth at first Chaos came to be, but next wide-bosomed <a href="#gaia">Gaia</a>, the ever-sure foundation of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympus…” - Hesiod, Theogony translated by Hugh G.

<h4 id="gaia-2.0">Gaia 2.0</h4>
<p>Iterating and adapting the work of Lovelock and Margulis, Bruno Latour expands this idea in response to the Anthropocene, or the “New Climatic Regime.” Science published remarks on three of the many features of this hypothesis: autotrophy, or natural systems that efficiently utilize free energy to make and remake; networks, or the activation of trash into treasure through “microbial networks” making up “global biogeochemical cycles;” and heterarchy, or decentralized resilience, resistance, and power.<span class="citation" data-cites="lenton_gaia_2018"><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></span></p>
<h4 id="hypothetical-threatprints">Hypothetical Threatprints</h4>
<p>Hypothetical threatprints refers to methods in social network analysis that deconstruct subjects to make legible what they can do, risks they represent, and link present and potential future threats.<span class="citation" data-cites="amoore_politicspossibility_2013a"><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></span> Louise Amoore, expanding on ideas from Tom Black, describe this breaking down and remaking of data points, connecting lines, and network span.<span class="citation" data-cites="amoore_politicspossibility_2013a"><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></span></p>

<p>“We know nothing about a body until we know what it can do,” write Deleuze and Guattari, until we see “what its affects are, how they can or cannot enter into composition with other affects, with the affects of another body.”</p>

<h4 id="lived-multisensoriality">Lived Multisensoriality</h4>
<p>As described by Shannon Mattern, lived multisensoriality is a concept of how other animals might “perceive, inhabit, and construct their habitats.”<span class="citation" data-cites="Mattern2017Sep"><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></span> Frequently this alternative sensing experience is illustrated through technologies like 360 panoramic photography, virtual reality, and other interactives. Embracing lived multisensoriality can be a useful oblique strategy for disrupting mapping conventions and embracing feminist, critical, or queer perspectives. Mattern points to Diana Thater’s video installations, Studio Tomas Saraceno’s hybrid spider webs, Sam Easterson’s Animal-Cams, Spurse’s cornucopia of psychogeography and tactical urbanism, and the Environmental Performance Agency from Ellie Irons, Catherine Grau, andrea haenggi, and Christopher Lee Kennedy.<span class="citation" data-cites="Mattern2017Sep"><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></span></p>
<h4 id="the-milieu">The Milieu</h4>
<p>Milieu, from French for ‘middle’ or ‘medium’ or ‘environment,’ has been utilized by Michel Foucault to serve as a catch-all other. The milieu points to everything except what is known, measured – it refers to the edges, the undersides.</p>
<p>“Ignorant of nature’s ways led people in ancient times to invent gods to lord it over every aspect of human life. There were gods of love and war; of the sun, earth and sky; of the oceans and rivers; of rains and thunderstorms….Since the connection of cause and effect in nature was invisible to their eyes, these gods appeared inscrutable, and people at their mercy.” Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow, “The Grand Design”, 2010,<span class="citation" data-cites="hawking_granddesign_2010"><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></span>(p.17)</p>
<p>Where once gods of things reigned, now gods in the gaps are the prevailing deities, the divine existing in the craquelure and ravines that scar landscapes of reason. Too, the milieu is all that we know around but not about. The other, the it, the unknown unknowns.</p>
<h4 id="real">Real</h4>
<h5 id="real-time">Real Time</h5>
<p>Real time is a system event-response timing, based on temporal deadlines. The deadlines define whether a system has ‘succeeded’ or ‘failed.’ For signal processing and the input and output of information, the process output time must be no greater than the input sensing time, keeping lockstep with reality.</p>
<p>Real time might be contrasted with Unix Time or System Time. Beginning on the Unix epoch at midnight, January 1st, 1970, system time linearly increments upwards, forwards. At time of writing, it is 1543075329 seconds since 01/01/1970 (UTC). On January 19, 2038 this time stamp will no longer function due to 32-bit limitations.<span class="citation" data-cites="unixtimestamp_unixtime_2018"><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></span></p>
<h5 id="real-life">“Real Life”</h5>
<p>“Real life” is a pointer to events or actions occurring away from a screen. Distinctions between “real” and “digital” appear to blur as the satirical nature of being is revealing, in such absurdisms at the election of Donald J. Trump, double rainbows, and metabolizing of procaine.</p>
<h4 id="shitposting">Shitposting</h4>
<p>Shitposting is an internet practice of creating and distributing intentionally low quality/effort content, frequently unfunny, in a sarcastic, spammy use of a social media platform or forum. TechCrunch points to a definition of misinformation, and the shitpostbot 5000 points to a consumption of this intentionally meaningless content.<span class="citation" data-cites="Biggs2016Sep"><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></span></p>
<h4 id="sociology-of-knowledge">Sociology of Knowledge</h4>
<p>T J Barnes looks to Bruno Latour and David Bloor for his history of regression and statistics, situating his analysis as sociology of knowledge. It is a general framework to dissect modes of knowledge generation at the same time as actors doing the generating. Broader than sociology of mathematics, statistics, or science, sociology of knowledge encapsulates cross-cutting interrogation of learning and research approaches; this critique might be carried out by reflective or critical practitioners, theoreticians, or several tribes of historians.</p>
<h4 id="situated-knowledge">Situated Knowledge</h4>
<p>Donna Haraway outlines situated knowledge as “a doctrine of embodied objectivity that accommodates paradoxical and critical feminist science projects.”<span class="citation" data-cites="haraway_situatedknowledges_23"><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></span> Such objectivity leaves room for the reality of being human, of emotion, and of our intrinsic contradictions. Situated knowledge is a holistic consideration of “subject and object” “as actor and agent” and recognizes communities and networks in place of sole individuals.<span class="citation" data-cites="haraway_situatedknowledges_23"><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></span></p>
<h4 id="sokal-affair">Sokal Affair</h4>
<p>The Sokal Affair is a controversy surrounding the article published in the Spring/Summer 1996 issue of Social Text, “Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity” by Alan Sokal. Sokal conceived and created this article satirically, as a spoof of 1990s critical theory and as a critique of lack of intellectual rigor in the humanities.<span class="citation" data-cites="sokal_physicistexperiments_1996"><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></span> The submission intended to test the editors of Social Test with an intentionally ill-constructed paper lacking in evidence, argument, and linearity; it was later revealed as a hoax targeting postmodern thinkers, Derrida chief among them.<span class="citation" data-cites="sokal_physicistexperiments_1996"><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></span></p>
<p>“The world was ersatz and actual, forged and faked, by ourselves and unseen others. Daring to attempt to absolutely sort fake from real was a folly that would call down tigers or hiccups to cure us of our recklessness. The effort was doomed, for it too much pointed past the intimate boundaries of our necessary fictions.” ― Jonathan Lethem, Chronic City 2009</p>
<h4 id="standard">Standard</h4>
<p>A standard is a rule or practice that has persisted and gained accepted authority. Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star outline standards’ capacity to link disparate and distance systems, enforceability by a governing authority, and staying power that precludes change.<span class="citation" data-cites="bowker_sortingthings_1999"><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></span> Standards are everyday yet invisible instances of the human drive to classify; Bowker and Star assert that many standards exist not because of “natural law” and that “[s]ometimes standards win due to an outright conspiracy.”<span class="citation" data-cites="bowker_sortingthings_1999"><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></span> Proliferated and hardened by the information age, Bowker and Star remind us that “[e]ach standard and each category valorizes some point of view and silences another” and that each standard established be deceptively neutral, but laden with morals, values, and inclinations.<span class="citation" data-cites="bowker_sortingthings_1999"><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></span></p>
<p>“ISO 639 provides two language codes, one as a two-letter code (ISO 639-1) and another as a three-letter code (ISO 639-2) for the representation of names of languages. ISO 639-1 was devised primarily for use in terminology, lexicography and linguistics. ISO 639-2 represents all languages contained in ISO 639-1 and in addition any other language, as well as language groups, as they may be coded for special purposes when more specificity in coding is needed. The languages listed in ISO 639-1 are a subset of the languages listed in ISO 639-2; every language code element in the two-letter code has a corresponding language code element in the three-letter code, but not necessarily vice versa.”</p>

<h4 id="technocratic-feedback-loop">Technocratic Feedback Loop</h4>
<p>Emily Kaufman establishes the technocratic feedback loop as a snowball effect of bureaucratic systems that self-repeat and reinforce.<span class="citation" data-cites="kaufman_policingmobilities_2016a"><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></span> Kaufman points to policing practices that gather data, indicating the need for more policing; in conducting more policing, our men and women of the force gather data that indicates the need more policing.<span class="citation" data-cites="kaufman_policingmobilities_2016a"><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></span> Ad infinitum: data, policing, data, policing.

<h4 id="technopositionality">Technopositionality</h4>
<p>Drawing from Matthew Wilson, technopositionality is a situated, critical practice in GIS and geography.<span class="citation" data-cites="wilson_newlines_2017a"><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></span> Reflective, technopositional works are “simultaneously about and with the technology.”<span class="citation" data-cites="wilson_newlines_2017a"><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></span> This craft indicts technical and social, and analyzes the act of research and the provenance behind it.<span class="citation" data-cites="wilson_newlines_2017a"><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In horology, or the repair and maintenance of clocks, ‘witness marks’ or ‘case marks’ are small dings or dents left behind from past workers tools, hands. These marks serve as clues for otherwise inscrutable machines, simultaneously a signifier of tradition and conveyor of information.</p>
<h4 id="urban-science">Urban Science</h4>
<p>Urban science is a set of processes that seek to combine algorithmic methods, procedural decision-making, and computational and data-driven efficiencies together with planning practice.</p>
<p>Urban Science is a new undergraduate degree and departmental focus between urban planning (course 11) and computer science (course 6). Critical discourse on the program has criticized it as simultaneously historically revisionist – urban planning has had scientific capacities for some time (geography exists) – and techno-solutionist – eschewing context for code.</p>
