<p>Douglas Lee’s 1973 academic masterpiece ​<em>Requiem for a Large Scale Model</em>​<span class="citation" data-cites="lee_1973douglas_1973"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> has been credited for the nearly two decade retreat in large scale urban modeling. Introduced with an ​Alice in Wonderland‡ and sprinkled with John Tenniel llustrations from the original ​Alice publishing, the article itself is a logical and technical argument for why large scale models have failed to achieve their stated goals and why there is reason to believe that they never will achieve such goals. Where a generation of would be land use modelers failed to revive their trade by countering the specific arguments presented in ​Requiem​, social and political events beyond the academy set the groundwork for the eventual reemergence of land use modeling. The 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments (1977 CAAA) set the course for later legal action, <em>Citizens for a Better Environment v. Deukmejan et al</em> (<em>Citizens v. Deukmejan</em>)​, which would enshrine the social and legal importance of land use models. It is the intention of this paper to demonstrate how land use and transportation interaction (LUTI) models are deeply embedded within and influenced by social and political requirements.</p>
<p>My story is inspired in part by Jennifer Light’s <em>​Welfare to Warfare</em>,​ which documents the emergence of military contractors and associated approaches for decision making within the urban realm. Among other tools, organizations such as RAND brought with them simulation modeling as an approach for understanding complex dynamic systems. This history put much of my own research using land use models into a new light.</p>
<p>Consider Ira Lowry. One of the servers I worked on at the University of Maryland is playfully named Lowry in recognition of his pioneering work in urban systems modeling. Light’s book also highlights his role as a RAND consultant and employee who brought military computer simulation to planning and helped to forge linkages between the two worlds. Light’s research highlights the manner in which models served the social interest of assembled parties:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defense and aerospace executives and engineers found new employment as consultants to cities and federal urban programs. Think tanks and aerospace companies found new civil systems contracts. University scholars found military sponsorship for urban research. City administrators, both Democrats and Republicans, found new approaches to management. Yet average city dwellers found few visible effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jennifer Light 2003, pg. 8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though my own study puts aside Light’s argument regarding the effectiveness of modeling efforts, my story picks up, in many ways, where ​Welfare to Warfare​ left off. Where Light explains the social interests at play in the initial emergence of urban simulation modeling, from the early 1960s to the 1970s, I intend to similarly account for the specific social interests at play in its later reemergence in the 1990s.</p>
<p>In placing LUTI models into the social circumstances, I employ the concept of boundary objects as developed in the discipline of science and technology studies (STS). Boundary objects are “those scientific objects which both inhabit several intersecting social worlds… and satisfy the informational requirements of each of them.”<span class="citation" data-cites="star_institutionalecology_1989"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> Such objects have different meaning to each social group involved, but nonetheless allow for communication between groups. The existing literature on boundary objects has focused primarily on their use in voluntary cooperation between parties that recognize aligning interest. The case of LUTI models, however, introduces their potential as a device to facilitate negotiation between antagonistic parties. Working with the models as boundary object, I will also utilize the concept of a broker, a person or group of people charged with facilitating communication.<span class="citation" data-cites="brown_orgazingknowledge_1998"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> Though boundary objects are collective social constructions, Brokers often play outsized roles in their contour.<span class="citation" data-cites="kimble_innovationknowledge_2010"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Predicting the demise of land use modeling was indeed premature. As I will show, LUTI models have secured their place for future development and articulation not via abstract scientific value but via their specific value as boundary objects. In the next section, I will review the literature on boundary objects, indicating that they have not yet been sufficiently explored as tools for negotiation. Subsequently, I introduce the <em>Citizens v. Deukmejan</em> court case and review the role it played in the future of urban modeling. Finally, I draw conclusions about the power of models generate claims of authority and exclusion, but also provide points for contesting such exclusion.</p>
<p>Before exploring the literature on boundary objects, it will be helpful to further explain what LUTI models are so as to highlight their potential as boundary objects. Travel demand models, built initially in the 1950s for highway network planning, project overall regional transportation demand utilizing projections of regional household and employment growth, then translate that demand into actual network use. As actually built highways filled up faster than expected, some planners and engineers realized that highways fundamentally changed the structure of demand by making development in far away locations more attractive. Starting with the Lowry models in the 1960s, modelers developed land use components that provided transportation-sensitive projections of land use. Since their inception, the models have become more realistic and grounded in economic and sociological theory.<span class="citation" data-cites="wegener_landusetransport_2004"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> Though often black boxes that take hours to run, their very complexity allows for multiple points of communication. Where one might declare a simpler model wholly right or wholly wrong, LUTI models provide a flexible platform to contest various elements of the real system by way of reference to its digital representation.</p>

<h2 id="boundary-objects-and-their-use">Boundary Objects and Their Use</h2>
<p>Star and Griesemer introduce boundary objects to deal with the problem of scientific cooperation among groups with different viewpoints yet aligning interests. Their work builds on the actor-network theory of Callon, Law, and Latour, which explains how scientific progress requires the recruitment of a wide variety of both human and non-human actors.;<span class="citation" data-cites="callon_elementssociology_1985"><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span><span class="citation" data-cites="law_technologyclosure_1987"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span>;<span class="citation" data-cites="latour_pasturizationfrench_1988"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span>. What interests Star and Griesemer is how so many parties might be brought to cooperate in the scientific endeavor given that the direct interests of scientists, such as the generation of new academic theories and papers, often does not align with those of their allies. They thus propose boundary objects as essential, collectively constructed tools for facilitating communication. Boundary objects are flexible for social use but strongly structured within the context of a specific social group.</p>
<p>Star and Griesemer illustrate how standardizing collecting procedures at the nascent Museum of Vertebrate Geology acted as boundary object, allowing all parties to advance their own social aims while serving functions that enhance the research goals and authority of the Museum.<span class="citation" data-cites="star_institutionalecology_1989"><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span> Joseph Grinnell, the museum’s first director, acquired specimens of sufficient quality and documentation to develop his evolutionary biology hypothesis. Annie Alexander, the museum’s backer built a collection to demonstrate the potential of conservation and garner greater support for it amongst the public. The University promoted its reputation as it sought national recognition, amateur collectors sought to legitimize their efforts and interest in conservation, and trappers sought a new, well-defined market. With reference to standardized collecting procedures, the various communities could align their efforts, the advancement of science complimenting their own personal aims.</p>
<p>The concept of a ‘boundary object’ encounters that of ‘broker,’ a party tasked with facilitating communication among cooperating groups.<span class="citation" data-cites="brown_orgazingknowledge_1998"><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span> Brokers are most effective when their social interest aligns with the declared goal of the larger project. Guiding the creation of boundary objects is an effective means for a broker to facilitate communication when parties agree on the potential of cooperation.<span class="citation" data-cites="kimble_innovationknowledge_2010"><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> Kimble et al elucidates broker guided boundary objects with examples from the development of a content management system and a health care network in France, emphasizing that brokers are most effective when their social interest aligns with the goals of the collective endeavor.</p>
<p>Much of the literature on boundary objects has drawn from situations in which they either served to harmonize desperate parties in the collective endeavor or allow parallel groups to utilize related technology. In Star and Griesemer, the museum president acts as a broker–carefully crafting procedures to align disparate parties to their interest.<span class="citation" data-cites="star_institutionalecology_1989"><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span> Kimble et al. describes two situations in which groups knew that the rewards of communication were worth the difficulties, as exemplified by the establishment of a health network to seek federal funding.<span class="citation" data-cites="kimble_innovationknowledge_2010"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span> In a study of GIS technology, Harvey and Chrisman argue that individual planning agencies work in parallel but have a shared interest in technological claims to authority.<span class="citation" data-cites="harvey_boundaryobjects_1998"><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The case of LUTI models will demonstrate their use as boundary objects in cooperative settings but also their use in the combative environment of the courtroom. I look to Harvey et al.: “[t]his constructed arrangement provides coherence for multiple participants and plays out various forms of power relations. The arrangement simultaneously includes some groups and excludes others”<span class="citation" data-cites="harvey_boundaryobjects_1998"><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></span> (pg. 1687). The parties present in the creation of boundary objects pursue these exclusions intentionally, in an effort to create defensive barriers around valued forms of expertise or favored paradigms. Credentials within professional fields provides an example. As boundary objects between government and practitioners, the government establishes means to ensure quality and hold practitioners accountable. In exchange, the professionals receive official recognition and exclusion of competing practices.</p>
<p>The use of boundary objects in the creation of new boundaries also places those objects in precarious social and, as in my case, legal positions. In order to attack the exclusionary structure, outside parties can attack the boundary object. If the outsider community succeeds in upsetting the existing scientific and social alliances, they are again left with a situation of challenged communication between parties. This might lead to the generation of new boundary objects or the redefinition of old ones such that they provide grounds for including the new community. The case presented here is an example of the latter.</p>
<h2 id="citizens-for-a-better-environment-v.-deukmejan-et-al"><em>Citizens for a Better Environment v. Deukmejan et al</em></h2>
<p>The 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments (1997 CAAA) is an unlikely ally of LUTI modeling. The 1977 CAAA does not explicitly direct any party to consider the implications of land use on air quality. However, following on building concern with growing air pollution from the transportation sector, the 1977 CAAA instructed the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Urban Development, and State and local officials to produce guidelines. This required enhanced methods to identify and evaluate alternative pollution control measures.<span class="citation" data-cites="n_cleanair_1977"><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In total, the 1977 CAAA set air quality standards and required that states develop plans for both stationary and transportation-related sources. This allowed leeway for local governments to develop their own pathways towards compliance so long as they demonstrated their capability to meet the standards. Within the transportation sector, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), as the federally designated regional transportation planning authority, adopted much of the responsibility for planning. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (1991 CAAA) and the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) would expand and place more teeth into these requirements, but by that time, <em>Citizens v. Deukmejan</em> had already established the enforceability of such standards and centralized the role of modeling in such work.<span class="citation" data-cites="garrett_transportationplanning_1996"><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="n_cleanair_1977"><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Though land use modeling had largely retreated to academic circles, large scale modeling of the transportation sector (as promoted within engineering) had continued unabated.<span class="citation" data-cites="wegener_landusetransport_2004"><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></span>‡‡ Regional MPOs had been utilizing models to assess the performance of proposed highway networks. With the 1977 CAAA requiring assessment of air quality impacts from the transportation sector, MPOs reasonably built extensions of their existing tools rather than building new models. These extensions assumed fleet composition to determine emissions coefficients and applied them to the traffic flow outputs of four step transportation models.<span class="citation" data-cites="garrett_transportationplanning_1996"><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span> These models provided MPOs with lower-cost solutions to their new planning and compliance requirements, while conferring the EPA and other agencies a semi-standardized means to assess the planning taking place.</p>
<p>This arrangement proved perilous when many regions failed to meet air quality standards. Emissions from the transportation sector were increasing in spite of state requirements for cleaner vehicles. In this context, two lawsuits were brought against the parties responsible for air quality in the Bay Area: 1) the aforementioned <em>Citizens v. Deukmejan</em> and 2) <em>Sierra Club v Metropolitan Transportation Commission, et al</em> which was eventually rolled into <em>Citizens v. Deukmejan</em> by the presiding Judge Theodore T. Henderson. Though there were multiple issues in the case, I will focus in on the role of the transportation model run by the Metropolitan Planning Commission (MTC), the local MPO.</p>
<p>The Sierra Club raised three central contentions. First, that the existing modeling procedure only projected emissions at a single end date and that was insufficient to ensure continuous drawdown in emissions. Second, they reasoned that conformity should be assessed on a project basis relative to absolute reduction required rather at the network level relative to the ‘business as usual’ future. Finally, they argued that the Projective Optimization Land Use Information System (POLIS) model in use by the MTC did not fully account for the impacts of new transportation infrastructure. In response, the MTC argued that the first requirement would prove too arduous, that project-based assessment is meaningless, and that POLIS provided sufficient assessment of land use impacts via travel time feedbacks. Given the technical, model-specific issues raised by the plaintiff, Judge Henderson took an unusual interest in the substance of the model, requesting court appointed transportation planning expert Martin Wachs, to aid in the negotiating a new modeling approach.<span class="citation" data-cites="garrett_transportationplanning_1996"><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="garrett_transportationplanning_1996"><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The judge ordered the parties to settle on the future of Bay Area transportation modeling and each side requisitioned the support of transportation modeling experts to support their case. More specifically on the topic of land use, the hired transportation expert for the Sierra Club, Dr. Peter Stopher, argued that the procedures embedded in the POLIS model did not account for the latent demand, trips not taken because the model did not adjust for overall travel demand changes, and would thus underestimate inter and intra urban household location changes due to the convenience or inconvenience of the transportation network. The MTC expert, Harvey Supp, countered that there existed no proof that changes in transportation network impacted overall growth levels and that no such model existed in practice to determine such impacts.<span class="citation" data-cites="garrett_transportationplanning_1996"><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The negotiated settlement did not require that the MTC adjust its procedures for modeling land use but the court did acknowledge land use as a legitimate matter of transportation and emissions planning. National decision makers took notice and incorporated the linkage into the ISTEA, which addresses land use and transportation together at thirteen times throughout the legislation, making clear the requirement to include it in planning, and hence modeling. The federal government also established the Transportation Model Improvement Program with land use modeling included as a primary component.</p>
<p>Though Judge Henderson’s written ruling does not mention the model methodology directly, his power to guide to judicial process affirms transportation modeling as the means for evaluating compliance with plans. Further, the judge could have ruled on the legal merits of the plan outside of the modeling framework, but decided to make an issue of the technical details, thus forcing parties to move towards consensus on a modeling framework. The ruling went so far as to threaten the delay of major transportation projects should projections indicate that they will fail air quality standards, thus implicating the essential importance of determining how the modeling must take place.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="n_intermodalsurface_1991"><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></span></p>
<h2 id="luti-models-and-contested-boundary-objects">LUTI Models and Contested Boundary Objects</h2>
<p>Before returning to the role of the transportation model within <em>Citizens v. Deukmejan</em>, it’s important to emphasize that the model already existed as a boundary object. In fact the model had two prior lives. Before the 1977 CAAA, the MTC had developed a four-step transportation model for highway planning. This model served as boundary object between the MTC, other regional agencies, and the US Department of Transportation (USDOT). Without denying that the model may have provided decision makers with some real analytic power, I note that the model lends authority to MTC decisions while providing the USDOT a standardized but flexible framework for assessing the transportation investment intentions of states and regions.</p>
<p>When the 1977 CAAA arrived, the MTC had good reason for adopting a similar approach in their relationship with the EPA. In fact, they argued in court that the transportation plans approved by the EPA be thought of as guidelines, not requirements. This aligned with planning approaches of the day and also expresses the necessary relationship between large scale transportation models of that vintage and the plans modeled through them. In the second life of the transportation model the EPA became a partner as well. Just at with USDOT, the model provided a common ground to facilitate oversite.</p>
<p>Model-enhanced claims of expertise can be used towards exclusionary ends. By utilizing a complex ‘black box’ model, MTC and MPOs around the country buttressed the argument that transportation planning is too complex for lay oversight. USDOT and EPA approval in the use of the model further justifies such exclusivity. This all implies that any failure and future improvements are matters to be negotiated between the EPA and MPOs. In fact, the EPA had already declared the Bay Area out of compliance and was in the process of developing guidelines for a new plan.The MTC frequently referenced this development in court, claiming that the citizen groups were interfering with an ongoing process.<span class="citation" data-cites="garrett_transportationplanning_1996"><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Building claims of authority on a boundary object also provides a leverage point which outsider communities may target to bring themselves into conversation. In targeting the model, the plaintiffs targeted an object through which they could express claims grounded by common understanding. Arguments regarding how the model ought to work or how results should be interpreted demonstrate an attempt to establish communication in a location that allows for clear negotiation and resolution. The judge and Martin Wachs acted as specially selected brokers. By the conclusion of the case the judge was adjudicating the future of a LUTI model in order to address the future of transportation emissions management.</p>
<p>We see a LUTI model (as boundary object) acting as a tool for negotiation rather than collaboration. The tool still serves the purposes of communication; however, rather than simply translating the viewpoints into a flexible object of interest, it translates demands. Arguing for the model to better simulate the impacts of transportation on the locations of households is more compelling and graspable for the MTC than vague accusations of failure to consider land use. In the actual structures of model simulation, the plaintiffs can make clear exactly the manner in which they understand this relationship. This will never fully reconcile perspectives but the model provides a text which both parties can read and edit.</p>
<p>The role of a broker changes in such a setting. When brokers are expected to foster collaboration, it is sufficient to find an individual within the social arrangement whose personal goals are largely aligned with the collective goals that brought groups together. In the case of negotiation, a trusted broker must occupy a presumably disinterested role. While the plaintiffs attacked the original use of the model as a boundary object, they were able to use it constructively in negotiation once the judge took up the task of facilitating changes to its form.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>In the conclusion of the case, the plaintiffs, the MTC, and the judge negotiated changes to the transportation model, but this didn’t include adjustments to the land use component. The subsequent enactment of the ISTEA and the creation of the Transportation Model Improvement Program, nonetheless, make it clear that the plaintiffs were successful in demanding that transportation and emissions planning better account for the feedback between transportation and land use. This led to a rebirth in LUTI modeling and, of course, many new boundary object LUTI models facilitating communications between MPOs, federal agencies, and (one also hopes) engaged citizens.</p>
<p>At a broader level <em>Citizens v. Deukmejan</em> presented a different potential for boundary objects: they can translate not only amicable conversations amongst allies but also demands and counterarguments amongst competing parties. When parties remain far apart or have incompatible perspectives, they might turn to boundary objects to engage in a proxy war. Complex computational models provide an excellent object for such a negotiation because they allow parties to discuss the system in question without actually talking about the system – to be specific in complaints when actually discussing abstraction. If LUTI modelers feel threatened by the ghosts of Lee, they should feel assured that their tools will likely remain socially useful without reference to their accuracy.</p>
