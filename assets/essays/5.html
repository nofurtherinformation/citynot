<h1 class="title">Musings on the Nature of Naming, Politics, Power, and Imagination</h1>
<p class="author">Maia Woluchem</p>
<p>Today’s understanding of categorization, organization, and order has been driven by a long history largely out of sight from our current conceptions of the world. Ian Hacking explores a definition of dynamic nominalism that underlies this concept, a doctrine by which human beings and human acts come into being once we define a way to name them.<span class="citation" data-cites="hacking_historicalontology_2004a"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> If that is true, by whose naming of what and of whom did we come to know ourselves?</p>
<p>I’d argue that the arc of American history has given the privilege of naming bodies, circumstances, understanding of poverty and success, to a small group of individuals in political, economic and social power; thus creating a world that comes into being based on the decisions of those sharing a particular set of values, rather than essential truths. As self-evident as that may be, this concept is essential to our understanding—particularly because a close relationship to power has been a traditionally white, landowning endeavor. As Simone Browne writes in her book “Dark Matters”, in regards to the branding of slaves by white masters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“… branding was not only a mass corporate and crown registration of people by way of corporeal markers, but an exercise of categorization whereby those deemed most fit to labor unfreely, that being the “good and sound,” were distinguished from others and imprinted, literally, with the mark of the sovereign. Here, African children, women, and men were violently made objects for trade. Slave branding was a racializing act. By making blackness visible as commodity and therefore sellable, branding was a dehumanizing process of classifying people into groupings, producing new racial identities that were tied to a system of exploitation.<span class="citation" data-cites="browne_darkmatters_2015"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote could be a shocking historical note were it not that control and power compound over time. And because they have, the idea of classification in this manner has persisted—at times for exploitation, at times to exert control, and always by recommending itself as the best way to understand the issues in our society.</p>
<p>Today many of our urban issues still exist to be measured by a system of characterization laid first by the small circle of white, landowning elites who set our foundation, and societal forces that have grown into existence in their wake. As an example, the legacy of conceptualizing land as property is foundational to how we consider the affordable housing crisis today. Similarly, a Census-driven categorization of race drives our understanding of ethnicity, nationality, and community cohesion.<span class="citation" data-cites="kertzer_censusidentity_2002"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> In short, today’s built and social environments are often framed around the broad historical arcs laid first by those in power, and perpetuated by our relative inability to contest those categorizations without significant political and legal action. These epistemologies have driven a particular kind of lived experience, one that elevates what we can adequately describe, and stymies what we cannot see or describe well.</p>
<p>To elevate an alternative ontology takes an act of extraordinary creativity and political bravery—as was the case with our first community land trust, or the push to diversify our understanding of gender. These alternatives have deeply historical roots, existing in the margins long before their emergence in the mainstream understandings of society. To do the work of bringing them mainstream, these ideas all necessitated a ‘quorum’ or an act of bravery by a group of individuals willing to sacrifice to push these new frameworks. In absence of these extraordinary efforts, we’re living in a world that’s inherently political–driven foremost by a deeply historical, partial, and frayed ability to see, count, and describe our experiences.</p>
<p>And so, an essential question: what is the relationship between concentrated historical power and our ability to see and understand our own personhood and our own stories today? In my opinion, the two are intractable. Characterizations of our legitimacy are everywhere—in our understanding of what we consider undocumented migration, subaltern spaces, and informal economies—all stemming from power dynamics that, unless recent, are difficult to capture. For those who are in marginal, unseen spaces or identities (though this framing begs the question—unseen by whom?), this ability to fit into narratives about validity written long ago underlie so much of what it means to participate in the world.</p>
<p>Today, considering and questioning prevailing notions of validity is an urgent necessity as it is a fundamental motivation of our drive towards data. This is true not just because data is valuable in an epistemological sense, but because it is also now so deeply embedded in our policy decisions, our governmental programs, our understanding of neighborhood dynamics, and the ways in which we’re able to categorize ourselves. This data is also increasingly ever more complete—representing all aspects of ourselves that had been largely out of sight for generations.<span class="citation" data-cites="crawford_anxietiesbig_2014"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> In short, data is our political, social, and interpersonal activities made legible. That nature of data is as promising as it is insidious. And without the extraordinary imagination and drive to create new frameworks, it can similarly recreate the narrower conceptions of the world that we see in political spaces.</p>
<p>Therefore, the need for greater political imagination is extremely urgent—not only due to the increasingly ubiquitous nature of data, but the changing nature of our communities. In neighborhoods across the country, harmful federal rhetoric about ethnic minorities, undocumented families, and many other vulnerable communities has slowly pushed some of our more marginalized people to the shadows while elevating the safer, most palatable understandings of ourselves.<span class="citation" data-cites="keddingseagletribune_climatefear_"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> But regardless of this denial, our neighborhoods are still changing, our world becoming more diverse and more complex with each passing day. Without harnessing our political and legal power, the data seen around us will reflect a power structure that does not fit this complexity, erasing our ability to see and understand our particular selves and the specificities of our cities.</p>
<p>This paper intends to understand this tension. What happens when concentrated power (manifesting through data) meets the complex, diverse urban spaces we now live in today? As with the political imagination that creates the community land trust in order to push back on considerations of property rights, can a more creative political imagination push the boundaries of community self-representation in our world? And should we even be aiming for more expansive notions of legibility when there are inherent benefits in remaining uncaptured and “invisible”, especially at this politically fraught time? This paper explores two pre-existing examples of pushback to federal paradigms in order to highlight cases where our collective ability to see ourselves through data has expanded by pushing back on concentrated power. It aims to bring dynamic nominalism to a more practical application, illustrating that the next dynamic shift could and should be in the hands of whoever is bold enough to take it.</p>
<p>###A Federal Adventure in Creating New Paradigms—What Can Be Gleaned from Trying New Things?</p>
<p>The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was intended to do a number of things, but is remembered primarily as an attempt to codify some of the aims of the concurrent Civil Rights movement: addressing the segregationist policies upheld by brokers, the federal government, and individual actors in housing provision. The Act was born out of a moment of deep legislative conflict between Congressional liberals and Southern conservatives who disagreed on Congress’s role in legislating the seemingly independent choices of individual homeowners. Many were also pained by the expediency of the moment, as the Act was passed within a week of Dr Martin Luther King’s passing.<span class="citation" data-cites="dubofsky_fairhousing_1968"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> Nonetheless, the Fair Housing Act was born from a moment of major tension, highlighting the ever-present struggle between prescribing equitable policy decisions to a polity or leaving the individual bodies of the autonomy to figure it out for themselves.</p>
<p>As was noted in 1969, the case for fair housing legislation included “psychological significance to blacks who will be able to escape the ghetto and the increased opportunities for employment and for decent education.”<span class="citation" data-cites="dubofsky_fairhousing_1968"><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> As expected, the conservative argument drew much of its fervor from a fear of losing both power and economic value. At the time, tensions were particularly high related to the perceived loss in white housing value, should black people be allowed into these traditionally segregated neighborhoods. This argument between mobility and place-based effects is still alive and well today.</p>
<p>Though contentious, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 was passed months after this initial battle, ushering in new legacies by the prohibition of discrimination based on race, color, religion and national origin. However, the legislation was still illustrative of these initial tensions and hesitant to prescribe Congressional policy decisions regarding fair housing, no matter the urgency. Within the Act was a phrase that would come to haunt the world of fair housing from thenceforth, urging actors to work on “affirmatively furthering fair housing”, but remaining vague on the details. The first semblance of any inclination to make good on that promise was language about affirmative fair housing marketing plans, then ascribed to those accessing funds through the now-defunct Farmer Home Administration (FmHA). As the language of the Act says, “An Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan is required to be prepared and submitted to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 by the contractor…using form HUD 935.2”<span class="citation" data-cites="n_423608_"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span>, to be reinforced through review by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p>The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was largely unenforceable because of the looseness of this phrasing, which asked for little data or metric capacity to operationalize these arguments and was fairly vague about what a fair housing marketing plan should entail. In fact, Form 935.2 (now Form 935.2a) still exists today and is relevant to anyone advertising a multi-family building with HUD funding, which incidentally is most of our multi-family stock today. Though the form has surely undergone some edits since its initial release, even its current iteration is entirely opaque on the metrics needed to operationalize that dream—a legacy drawn upon the initial desire to obscure the contentious issue of fair housing and limit its effects.<span class="citation" data-cites="departmentofhousingandurbandevelopment_affirmativefair_"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
<p>As a result, the Fair Housing Act was a concentrated effort that in some cases unfortunately beget complacency in the realm of fair housing. By remaining purposefully vague about the need for performance metrics and data to measure and actively fight for fair housing, authors of the Act inadvertently (or perhaps not so inadvertently) enabled cheating in the housing market, provided relatively few universal tools with which to reinforce integration, and underwrote growing resentment by those who rejected the state’s infraction on their ability to live in communities that they felt autonomy over. As noted already, power compounds, and the legacy of these poor housing policies is significantly more marked today. Current wealth disparities by race are as expansive as they are largely due to this inability for blacks initially locked out of homeownership and place-based opportunity to find housing that is safe, stable, affordable and in good, well-resourced neighborhoods.<span class="citation" data-cites="coates_casereparations_2014"><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In 2015, the Obama Administration took incredible aims to address the problem—capitalizing upon a particularly favorable political tone to bring metrics and data to the then-vague question of fair housing. The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule (AFFH) was implemented in 2015, tying real strategy, data reporting, and collection requirements to the communities applying for federal funding for housing.<span class="citation" data-cites="n_affirmativelyfurthering_"><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span> In order to receive funding from HUD for their projects, entitlement communities were required to submit an Assessment of Fair Housing, mandating them to enumerate goals for expanding fair housing in their communities, and a number of metrics by which they would measure these goals. They were also each required to submit profiles of their communities, using some metrics set forth by HUD itself. Each Assessment was subject to review and refusal—and of the 49 submitted, 17 were roundly rejected for the failures of their metrics to demonstrate actionable results.<span class="citation" data-cites="n_nationalfair_"><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Interestingly and most importantly, a new concentration of power beget a new set of tools, born of creative imagination and the political will to do so. Insurgency-lite, if you will. At the time, the administration was in a particularly favorable moment to push for new ways of measurement—instituting tools that addressed our more nuanced understandings to give weight to the issues of segregation. One such tool is the Dissimilarity Index, first proposed by Drs. Massey and Denton in 1988 to measure the evenness in opportunity among varying communities of color.<span class="citation" data-cites="weinberg_racialethnic_"><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span> Others were proposed by the cities in their own Assessments, like in Seattle (which has a strong legacy of commitments to racial equity and justice), through its Race and Social Justice Initiative and questioned the very notion of white supremacy’s overlay in this context.<span class="citation" data-cites="n_racesocial_"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span> In their Assessment, they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Finally, members of Seattle’s Race and Social Justice Equity Change Teams challenged HUD’s prioritizing of integrated neighborhoods in high opportunity white communities as potentially biased toward the dominant culture in and of itself. Many communities struggling with the Assessment of Fair Housing will have to deal with a lack of consensus regarding placing high value on integrated communities while respecting individual choice to reside in communities of affinity whether by race, religion, immigrant status, or community history.”<span class="citation" data-cites="cityofseattle_2017city_2017"><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, their discussions of goals and metrics were slightly more subversive, using these frameworks to institute more nuanced policy at the local level. In all, the introduction of data and metrics to fair housing has allowed communities to enact the measurable change we want to articulate, much more than any previous articulation of fair housing legislation. This is true for many of the jurisdictions among the 49 cities, like Temecula, CA, where leaning into specificity allows for policies like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Adopt an Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) Program by Amending Title 17 of the Municipal Code (Zoning Code) to accommodate Temecula’s regional housing need for 2,007 affordable units for lower income households. The City will establish an AHO on at least 100 acres. After the establishment of the AHO, sites identified will require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum densities of 20 units per acre</li>
<li>50% of need (1,003 units) will be on sites allowing exclusively residential uses</li>
<li>Multi-family uses at the densities established under the AHO will be allowed by right, without a conditional use permit</li>
<li>Affordable Housing Overlay expected adoption by City Council by June 30, 2018. (CF 1A)”</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As it were, the need for greater political imagination in this space is infinitely more urgent, now that power has once again taken back our ability to name, measure, and therefore affect our local policies and built environment. Upon his entrance to the Cabinet, new HUD Secretary Ben Carson suspended the AFFH rule, though many cities across the country are still carrying out plans under its auspices.<span class="citation" data-cites="thrush_bencarson_2018"><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></span> Once again, the narrative shift by those of a particular persuasion strikes back, but the momentum that began by offering alternative ways of seeing is now deeply affecting the lives of those at the city level. Despite Ben Carson, we are still celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Fair Housing Act this year. By even allowing municipalities to enter into a conversation bringing new data to the forefront, the AFFH rule has ushered in 49 different ways of seeing and naming the world, the aftereffects of which are still to be measured.<span class="citation" data-cites="n_assessmentsfair_"><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p>
<p>What is the lesson here? I’d argue that the lesson is in regarding new framings as particularly beautiful moments of generation. Data is just a starting point towards a new way of granting legitimacy and providing a new way to see and affect change in our world. However, doing so requires a particularly rare combination of magic—the political will to act, and the ability to really count the things we want to see.</p>
<p>###HMDA – Bringing out New Versions of the World</p>
<p>Though the policy prescriptions in the previous example are most related to the powers that be, there are others that drive from grassroots power. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act came from one such movement. Initially, the Act was conceived as a method to end redlining in communities across the country.<span class="citation" data-cites="marsico_lookingback_"><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></span> The Act requires financial institutions to disclose information about their individual loan activities to the public—which at the time of its passing, was essential information for those looking to track nefarious behavior by financial institutions. Since, it has been an incredible tool for anti-discrimination work: allowing anyone who access the data to sunlight the issues that are affecting housing provision in any community in the United States.</p>
<p>The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) grew out of several years of strong activism from community organizers, looking for verifiable proof to address the pains of redlining in their communities. Organizers like Chicago’s Gale Cincotta used a wide range of tactics (not least of which included searching public property records), forcefully confronting lenders at their offices and organizing collaboratively across communities to prove the existence of redlining throughout the country. Figures such as Cincotta were instrumental to galvanizing the groundswell needed to bring national attention to the issue. (In doing so, she once flirted with nailing a “Loan Shark” sign to the door of the Federal Reserve).<span class="citation" data-cites="martin_galecincotta_2001"><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></span> Though the shield was diverse, the hammer came through Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin—who championed the controversial bill through Congress, where it was hard-won.</p>
<p>Like the Fair Housing Act fight before it, the competition between the opposition was an ideological one. The former was interested in the means—addressing the pervasiveness of redlining in communities. The latter, the lending industry and federal regulators, were interested in engaging with the topic minimally but unwilling to do the work of assigning data and metrics to do it or prove it. On the heels of action by community organizers, Senator Proxmire opened the discussion on the floor with the fact that lenders “should not arbitrarily reject loan applications from sound credit risks on sound houses simply because he does not like the neighborhood, or because he fears it may at some future time decline.”<span class="citation" data-cites="marsico_lookingback_"><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></span> The racist underpinnings of the lenders’ arguments unveiled themselves further through the statements of other Congresspeople, who noted the irony of bank business that often took investments of redlined communities to invest in housing in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Senator Proxmire and his contemporaries released a series of increasingly damning criticism while offering many reasons why HMDA’s passage was imperative for the people and communities who had already put years of work into this issue on the ground. Highlighting the importance of HMDA’s disclosure mandate, Senator Edward Brooke of Massachusetts noted that community residents, many of whom had already been significantly involved in the efforts to unveil redlining locally, could use this information to divest from banks that did not lend in their neighborhoods, among other actions that would keep lenders accountable. Ultimately the critical partnership between the invested Congresspeople was best used to highlight the ways disclosure of this data galvanizes the public, those already working on this issue in their communities. In the end, community organizers won, ushering in one of the landmark legislations in the greater effort to fill gaps in public knowledge.</p>
<p>The essential tenets of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act are now to provide the public with yearly home loan data at the transaction-level. HMDA data describes the contours of each loan (including the amount, type, whether it was approved or withdrawn), descriptive statistics about the race, ethnicity and gender of the applicant, and a wide range of other variables most important to the communities looking to answer questions. Though it can illuminate the intrusiveness of redlining and give consumers a way to regulate nefarious lending practices, it also is an essential tool to understand the nature of our built environments.</p>
<p>As an example, this data has been used to understand the lack of penetration of homeownership in communities of color, and highlight difficulties in addressing income inequality.<span class="citation" data-cites="urbaninstitute_interactiveview_"><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span> It has just as often been used by financiers, to assess the market they’re entering into. Ultimately its use depends purely on the case, though its prominence in our ability to drive new policy and change is purely a result of the bravery and work of the disperse communities among us who demanded their issues be seen.</p>
<p>Similarly, moments of direct community action inspiring real data have been evidenced in a wide range of topic issues, not least of which include recent interest in the count of evictions through the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, and Sam Sinyangwe’s effort to quantify police violence.<span class="citation" data-cites="maharawal_antievictionmapping_2018"><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></span>;<span class="citation" data-cites="n_policehave_"><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></span> By building upon existing group-momentum and a strong political interest in building more equitable futures, efforts to quantify the previously unknown can also grant power to the unseen from mere legibility. Thus, I’d argue an addendum to the former—though power does truly underlie our ability to see what is in front of us, power in certain circumstances can be dispersed and it can be resolute. Actors in each of these spaces have benefited tremendously from having a unified mission in obscuring, defining, or elevating the truth, and have been in a particularly opportune moment and position to do so. Thus, as we consider more diverse conceptions of power and who can levy it, I’d hazard a guess that the outcomes and future representations of our world will also expand in kind.</p>
<p>###Why Do We Care In the First Place?</p>
<p>An alternative reading of this piece could beget a pessimistic undertone. “Cool, but also isn’t this kumbaya? Or overdramatic? Isn’t it too late? Who cares?”. The answer is probably all of the above, honestly. However, I’d argue that the relationships between numeracy, power, and the political moment is an incredibly urgent connection for us as a polity to consider.</p>
<p>Today’s political heavyweights rarely consider data a part of any conversation, and are swift to move on policies driven by the passion of the moment and a brazen misunderstanding of the problem.<span class="citation" data-cites="n_donaldtrump_"><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span> However, some critical readings of ontological practices will tell us that naming something gives us a particular power to see and affect that thing. By avoiding a conversation about how to quantify and name police brutality, discrimination, or segregation, we’re missing a major part of our cities. Similarly, by naming a vast and unexplainable problem by falsehoods and poor metrics, we are overemphasizing a particular lens in favor of those policies. As Trump incorrectly stated in late 2018 in regards to the migrant caravan on the border: “But I would say the violence is very strong. We have over 500 people that are serious criminals and gang members. And it’s a tough situation. We just don’t want that in our country. And we’re keeping it in Mexico.”<span class="citation" data-cites="n_factcheck_"><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></span> Truth be told, nobody has those actual numbers, but only a few people are in a position to wield the political power necessary to make them actionable. And should they, perhaps that again alters the nature of what we’re able to see, manage, and control—in ways which are harmful to our communities and who we want to be as a society.</p>
<p>I’d argue that political imagination is imperative to our understanding of cities. They’re mechanisms by which we can draw boundaries, blur lines, and leverage metrics and data by which we wield real, actionable change. They make the unseen legible, and the legible into a moveable piece of our society. Ultimately, data is a consequence of power, which is itself a consequence of the moment. Though the city is not a computer, it can be made in the image of one for better or worse, a manifestation of our values in computational form.</p>
