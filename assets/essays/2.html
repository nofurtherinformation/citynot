<h1 class="title">Alert! The Potential Behavioral Effects of Environmental Citizen-Sensing Initiatives&quot;</h1>
<p class="author">Adrianna Boghozian</p>
<p>In the next century, planet earth will don an electronic skin. It will use the Internet as a scaffold to support and transmit its sensations. This skin is already being stitched together. It consists of millions of embedded electronic measuring devices: thermostats, pressure gauges, pollution detectors, cameras, microphones, glucose sensors, EKG’s, electroencephalographs. These will probe and monitor cities and endangered species, the atmosphere, our ships, highways and fleets of trucks, our conversations, our bodies–even our dreams. Neil Gross, 1999, on the Internet of Things<span class="citation" data-cites="gross_earthwill_1999"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In the almost twenty years since Neil Gross’s prediction, society has made significant progress towards bringing the highly connected world he summarized into reality. The ubiquity of low-cost digital technologies has in many ways democratized the collection of environmental data, enabling everyone from data scientists to concerned citizens to monitor what was previously only in the purview of the government. According to Shannon Mattern, claims that the collection of this data can bring about solutions to complex societal problems (such as air pollution) have greatly increased (though she is largely skeptical of its promise). Mattern discusses trends of “data fetishism” and the “aestheticization and idolization of method” that she sees cities moving toward in an attempt to tackle some of society’s “stickiest urban problems.”<span class="citation" data-cites="mattern_methodolatryart_2013"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> In her book Program Earth, Jennifer Gabrys further explains, “it is through collecting data that everything from enhanced participation in environmental issues to changes in policy are hoped to be achieved.”<span class="citation" data-cites="gabrys_programearth_2016"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></span>,(p.159) This follows from the belief that data enables more effective modes of action in response to environmental problems. “Data are intertwined with practices, responses to perceived problems, modes of materializing and evidencing problems, and anticipations of political engagement.”<span class="citation" data-cites="gabrys_programearth_2016"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span>,(p.159) Thus it is through environmental monitoring and the dissemination of data to the public that environmental problems are understood to be more readily and effectively addressed.</p>
<p>This essay aims to explore not only the intended purpose of environmental monitoring and alert systems but the potential gap between their presumed and actual effects on human behavior. The first section summarizes the history of air quality monitoring along with the rise of ubiquitous sensor networks and citizen sensing initiatives, with an eye towards evaluating how well they promote citizen engagement and action. The next section focuses on federal air quality alert programs and recent evaluations of their effectiveness as far as public health is concerned. The essay concludes by attempting to expand the insights from these evaluations to citizen science initiatives, while highlighting potential areas of improvement.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-network">Building a Network</h2>
<p>Widespread environmental monitoring came about in the nineteenth century during the establishment of scientific observatories. Initially focused on astronomy, the observatories expanded to include “precision measurement, numerical data processing, and the representation of scientific information on a global or cosmic scale.”<span class="citation" data-cites="aubin_heavensearth_2010"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> Air became a topic of increased attention following the expansion of coal-fired manufacturing, culminating in historic air pollution events in the middle of the twentieth century.<span class="citation" data-cites="n_changingair_"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> Western governments responded to the perceived public health fears by drafting Clean Air Acts, such as those in the United Kingdom (1956)<span class="citation" data-cites="n_ukclean_1956"><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> and the United States (1963)<span class="citation" data-cites="usepa_overviewclean_2015"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span>; establishing federal programs aimed at regulating and controlling hazardous air pollutants. These laws further legitimized environmental monitoring efforts and drew heightened attention to the potential dangers that existed in the environment citizens interacted with daily.</p>
<p>There are many different types of air pollution, each with varying effects on human health. In order to more holistically understand air quality monitoring, it may be helpful to review what is actually in the air. Our atmosphere includes a combination of gases: nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), argon (0.93%), and carbon dioxide (0.04%) as well as other trace minerals.<span class="citation" data-cites="nasa_earthfact_2017"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span> Pollutants are usually measured in ppm (parts per million) or ppb (parts per billion) molecules of air. Common harmful pollutants can be generally characterized as a mixture of small particles such as particulate matter (PM) – like dust, soot, or drops of liquid – which are further broken down into coarse (PM10, &lt; 10 microns in diameter) and ultrafine (PM2.5, &lt; 2.5 microns in diameter). Pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are also shown to be harmful.<span class="citation" data-cites="environmentaldefensefund_healthimpacts_"><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span> The World Health Organization (WHO) labels ambient (outdoor) air pollution as a major cause of death and disease globally – attributing 4.2 million premature deaths from exposure to heart, lung, and cardiopulmonary disease, with the strongest evidence of public health concern linked to PM2.5 (especially deadly due to its invisibility to the human eye).[world_health_organization_ambient_2018] As Gabrys states, “Pollutants, in other words, are often present in seemingly miniscule quantities and yet are able to disrupt and remake environments, bodies, and ecological processes on local and global scales.”<span class="citation" data-cites="gabrys_programearth_2016"><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></span>,(p.163) Institutional and governmental bodies set standards for air pollution monitoring based on what health research determines as evidence of the level of harm caused by specific pollutants.<span class="citation" data-cites="gabrys_programearth_2016"><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></span>,(p.163) Thus despite the wide range of pollutants found in the air, a smaller subset are the focus of monitoring, as well as management and mitigation efforts.</p>
<p>Nowhere are the effects of these pollutants felt more acutely than in densely populated cities – particularly cities in the developing world (where pollution controls are lacking). Whereas coal pollution was the primary focus during the initial drafting of air legislation, the major pollutant sources are now automobile traffic and energy usage, which directly release the colorless and odorless (and dangerous) PM and NO2. As one can imagine, the burden of disease within a city is not equally dispersed; with populations closest to major urban roadways affected disproportionately.<span class="citation" data-cites="silvanadisabatino_spatialdistribution_2018"><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></span> Even though air quality standards are determined by the effect of air pollution on human health, monitoring and enforcement of those standards can be lacking at the individual level. Currently, regulatory-grade monitoring stations are large and expensive, resulting in only small numbers scattered throughout major cities despite the fact that pollution levels can vary widely due to the effect of buildings, wind patterns, and weather on pollutant dispersion.[12],(p.81) Furthermore, as individuals move throughout the city in the course of a given day, their compounded exposure levels can vary drastically, even though a monitoring station may find that pollution emitted from a distinct source may be within an allowed limit. Due to this effect, mitigation efforts have been focused on two primary strategies: emissions reduction (decreasing pollution from fixed sites) and exposure avoidance (encouraging individuals to monitor their exposure and take alternative routes through cities).<span class="citation" data-cites="gabrys_programearth_2016"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></span>,(p.164)</p>
<p>The latter strategy, notably, offers an opportunity for “citizen sensing” initiatives. These initiatives utilize the proliferation of low-cost digital sensor technologies and smartphones to crowdsource environmental data, making relevant information more immediately accessible to citizens as they move throughout the city. Networks of digital sensors deployed across an urban area allow for much richer spatial and temporal data than that captured by fixed, high-cost monitoring stations, and proponents argue that this dispersed mode of data collection enables effective modes of action on part of the citizen. Many of these networks – such as London Air Quality Network, Safecast, Plume, Air Visual, and AirNow – offer smartphone apps on which citizens can view their exposure levels in real time as well as receive alerts whenever the air quality around them falls below a certain level. All of these initiatives espouse the belief in open environmental data as an agent for change – that allowing citizens to become more informed leads them to make better decisions in their daily lives.</p>
<p>When considering the potential impact of this shift towards more distributed and democratized air quality data, questions begin to arise regarding what specifically is the intended citizen response? Exactly how does arming citizens with more detailed information on air quality enable them to engage differently with their environment? Many of the initiatives listed above lack distinct instructions on what they advise citizens to do with the data they provide. Though there have been few studies regarding the effect of open source air quality data on citizen behavior, we can draw lessons from the implementation of an earlier (and still widely implemented) form of information dissemination: federal air quality alert systems. The following section delves into the empirical effects of providing this information and attempts to apply conclusions to these new citizen-driven initiatives.</p>
<h2 id="do-we-heed-the-alerts">Do We Heed the Alerts?</h2>
<p>While ambient air quality has improved in many regions (specifically in high income countries), episodic spikes – which have the potential to trigger adverse health effects – remain common.<span class="citation" data-cites="chen_effectair_2018"><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></span> In 1968, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created the Air Quality Index (AQI)<span class="citation" data-cites="usepa_airnowair_2016"><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></span> which is used to report daily air quality levels for cities across the U.S. For each city, the EPA calculates a value according to the levels of the five major types of air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: PM, CO, NO2, O3, and SO2 collected from its monitoring stations. The AQI consists of six levels that range from Good to Hazardous (with a corresponding color scheme), depending on the potential health concern. State and local agencies are required to report daily air quality indexes for all U.S. cities with populations over 350,000.<span class="citation" data-cites="cho_whatyou_2018"><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></span> The information is updated daily, and it is freely available on the EPA’s website. On exceptionally bad days, it is disseminated through the media. There is also an option to automatically receive free air quality mobile alerts when high concentrations of dangerous pollutants are predicted in a citizen’s area.<span class="citation" data-cites="usepa_preparesummer_2018"><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></span> Additionally, cities may manage their own city-wide alert systems that, along with air quality, cover many different types of alerts including traffic, police activity, and weather. Many countries have very similar indexes and alert systems including Australia, Canada, China, India, Mexico, Singapore, U.K., and Europe.</p>
<p>These alert systems rely on similar assumptions as the citizen-focused air quality initiatives. Particularly, that by directing citizen attention to immediate environmental phenomena – whether it be through a smartphone app that is constantly monitoring the surrounding pollution or through a federal alert messaging system – citizens will adjust their behavior. This follows other digital information technologies such as electronic meters that modulate energy use or wearable fitness and sleep trackers that capitalize on the increasing trend of soliciting the attention of citizens in order to bring about behavior cha nge.</p>
<p>While probing the nature of attention in digital media, Matthew Wilson draws on the philosopher Bernard Stiegler’s criticisms of these technologies. While Stiegler suggests they can be thought of as powerful systems of care, he also argues that “contemporary power technologies no longer mainly aim at disciplining bodies or regulating life-processes, but at controlling and modulating consciousness”<span class="citation" data-cites="wilson_newlines_2017"><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></span>,(p.95-97); in other words, power acts through attention.</p>
<p>While Steigler is generally critical of these technologies and the new “economic system of attention”, his insights can inform the design of such systems. For a more productive take, Wilson references the work of Katherine Hayles: “It is far too simplistic to say that hyper attention represents a cognitive deficit or a decline in cognitive ability among young people. . . . On the contrary, hyper attention can be seen as a positive adaptation that makes young people better suited to live in the information-intensive environments that are becoming ever more pervasive.”<span class="citation" data-cites="wilson_newlines_2017"><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></span>,(p.95-97) It is important then to understand how successful these technologies are at directing attention in order to stimulate some desired behavioral response.</p>
<p>Until recently, little evidence of the effectiveness of city-wide air quality alert systems existed. Earlier this year, Hong Chen et al. (2018) published what they determined was the first study to comprehensively evaluate the effect of air quality alert programs on a wide array of public health outcomes.<span class="citation" data-cites="chen_effectair_2018"><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></span> The study took place in Toronto, Canada, a region where air pollution levels are on par with other high-income countries. The research team employed a robust regression discontinuity design to study the public health outcomes of Toronto’s city-wide air quality alert system on data from 2003 to 2012. The findings showed that though the alerts were related to some reductions in asthma-related emergency room visits on high pollution days, the system as a whole had no effect on mortality or cardiovascular disease. Overall, the researchers claim the alert program “yielded inadequate protection of the public from air pollution”<span class="citation" data-cites="chen_effectair_2018"><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></span>. Since Toronto’s air quality alert program relies solely on information campaigns – and thus emissions reduction is voluntary (rather than additionally requiring government action such as reducing traffic or shutting down factories[20]) – this study concludes that “interventions relying on information campaigns alone to encourage exposure avoidance and voluntary emission control could yield little benefit if not accompanied by mandatory actions.”</p>
<p>Additionally, while studies in the U.S. have shown that smog alerts have reduced attendance in public parks in Los Angeles<span class="citation" data-cites="neidell_airquality_2010"><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></span> and Atlanta<span class="citation" data-cites="noonan_smoggychance_2014"><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></span>, several other U.S. studies fail to link air quality alerts to behavioral change among the public.<span class="citation" data-cites="semenza_publicperception_2008"><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></span>;<span class="citation" data-cites="back_nationalevidence_2013"><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></span>;<span class="citation" data-cites="tribby_airquality_2013"><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></span> In fact, there is sufficient evidence that behavior response decreases as successive alerts are issued.<span class="citation" data-cites="graffzivin_dayshaze_2009"><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></span> A narrow study evaluating the behavioral impacts of air quality ozone alerts in Sydney, Australia on cycling behavior found that bicycling trips decreased by 25 percent in response to smog alerts. However, when alerts were issued over two consecutive days, there was no decrease on the second day. The study found larger impacts on the weekends compared to weekdays, suggesting that if cycling was utilized for commuting, there was less likelihood of substitution.<span class="citation" data-cites="saberian_behavioralimpacts_2014"><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></span></p>
<p>What do these studies suggest for the future applications of citizen-sensing initiatives? The final section aims to draw conclusions from the empirical results in order to highlight how they may be best utilized in regard to citizen behavior.</p>
<h2 id="bringing-behavioral-change-to-bear">Bringing Behavioral Change to Bear</h2>
<p>In an attempt to shed light on the potential of low-cost sensing initiatives, these evaluations provide possibly enough evidence to temper expectations related to changes in citizen behavior. If we are to apply the results of national air quality alert programs to citizen-driven initiatives, then we can deduce that there is some evidence to suggest that alerts trigger immediate citizen compliance, especially in regards to more at-risk populations. Though, overall it appears that large potential changes in behavior are less likely to occur, especially when citizens are asked to make more significant changes that may affect their daily lives (like changing their mode of commuting).</p>
<p>Yet, it is not entirely realistic to expect these new initiatives to function in exactly the same way as the government alert programs; the potential impacts could be more or less effective. With the ability to collect more fine-grained data and give personalized suggestions, low-cost monitoring offers a more granular approach to information disclosure. It may be interesting to consider an extreme example, such as Delhi, India (which coincidentally just rolled out its own city-wide alert system in October 2018<span class="citation" data-cites="mohan_govtlaunch_2018"><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></span>). Delhi is consistently ranked by the WHO as one of the world’s worst cities for air pollution<span class="citation" data-cites="irfan_whyindia_2018"><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></span>, with the capital city routinely setting mandatory bans on high polluting industry, construction activities, and heavy vehicles for days at a time when the air pollution reaches extreme levels.<span class="citation" data-cites="n_banconstruction_2018"><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></span> Since air pollution is a regular aspect of daily life to Delhi’s citizens, what does a city-wide alert system offer? In a city overcome with severe levels of air pollution up to months at a time, is it realistic to assume that citizens would adhere to city-wide recommendations that they stay indoors? At what point does the air pollution become deprioritized by the citizens who have to get on with living their lives? This may highlight the potential advantage of low-cost monitoring. Would citizens be more willing to abide by government suggestions if they were given realistic, catered options in which to alter their behavior? What about if these systems enabled citizens to actively care more about their environment?</p>
<p>There is a broader opportunity for these initiatives to embrace the strategy of directing attention to what is happening in a citizen’s environment. Where sensing up until this point has focused on the passive monitoring of the environment, these applications offer the opportunity to take a more active role in bringing about real behavioral change. As Wilson points out:</p>
<p>The point is to pay attention to attention as an object, to cultivate attention as care through technological engagements to confront what Stiegler considers a “systemic carelessness,” or, more profane, where “I don’t give a fuck” (je-m’en-foutiste) has become a persistent affect toward societal (human, environmental, cultural) challenges.<span class="citation" data-cites="wilson_newlines_2017"><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></span>,(p.113)</p>
<p>One can imagine a system in which caring about one’s environment is the ideal behavioral change, specifically when advocacy is a vital component to addressing such sticky, complicated societal problems as air pollution. “[P]erhaps technological engagement requires an awareness of the conditions of thought-action, to better frame interventions with technology by being aware of the tendencies toward attention craft and control.”<span class="citation" data-cites="wilson_newlines_2017"><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></span>,(p.112) In order to bring about real action, these initiatives offer the ability to modify existing behavior by exploiting hyper attentiveness. William Connolly writes “[t]hinking is not merely involved in knowing, explaining, representing, evaluating, and judging…. To think is to move something. And to modify a pattern of body/brain connections helps to draw a habit, a disposition to judgment, or a capacity of action into being.”<span class="citation" data-cites="wilson_newlines_2017"><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></span>,(p.112)</p>
<p>Overall, there exists potential for citizen-based, low-cost monitoring to fill the gap left by city-wide alert programs. With planetary urbanization continuing apace<span class="citation" data-cites="brenner_implosionsexplosions_2013"><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></span>, increasing the percentage of the world’s population exposed to extreme health consequences of air pollution, networks of sensors and personalized applications suggest promising avenues for tackling our most pressing environmental problems.</p>
